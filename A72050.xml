            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. How King <hi>Frederick</hi> and his Queene walking to take the ayre, were aſſaulted by a company of Out-lawes, &amp; how the Queene was deliuered of a child in the Forreſt.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU may read in the Chronicles of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, of the great loue betwéene King <hi>Frederick,</hi> &amp; the famous <hi>Alliſonne,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of Flaunders. And how that after a long contention, betwéene the ſaid <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and <hi>Griffory</hi> Duke of Holland, the King married her in the great Cittie of Gaunt, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame griefe of the ſaid <hi>Griffory,</hi> who therevpon gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all martiall exerciſes for a ſeaſon, vntill ſuch time as hée was reuenged, as you may more at large read of in the ſaid Chronicle, written by one <hi>Cleonido</hi> a Dane.</p>
               <p>Not long after the ſaid marriage, the King hauing ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the eſtate of that Earledome, returned into Denmarke with his beautifull Quéene, where at the arriuall, they were receiued with great honour and triumph by his ſubiects, who loued him as intirely, as it was poſſible for any ſubiects to loue their Prince, as appeared by their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proceſſions, ringing of bells, ſtaitly pagants, and other gallant ſhewes, which were preſented vnto him in euery Towne hée paſſed through. But comming into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iance,</hi> which then was the chiefe Cittie of the kingdome,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:4"/> hee was preſented with ſuch varietie of pleaſing ſhewes, that it paſſeth my capacitie to deſcribe them, likewiſe there were many excellent and learned Orations, pronounced by the chiefe ſchollers of the Vniuerſity of <hi>Maiance,</hi> ſetting foorth the great loue of the people toward their Prince, and the ioy conceaued of his marriage with ſo excellent a Lady as was his Quéene. On the otherſide, the King to grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſubiects louing mindes, ſhewed himſelfe bountifull and liberall vnto all, to ſome by gifts, to others by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and fayre words, and to all by pleaſing ieſtures, ſo that one might rightly ſay, there was in him the liuely portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a moſt graue and prudent Prince, and in them the true ſhew of faithfull and louing ſubiects.</p>
               <p>But as it alwaies hapneth, when men think themſelues in greateſt felicitie, then whether it be by the inſtabilitie of Fortune, or elſe that the Fates and deſtinies haue ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, they are oftentimes ſuddenly tumbled downe, into griefe and miſerie. Euen ſo it hapned with the King and Quéene, who liuing a while in this content, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly driuen into great cares and perplexitie. Wherby we may perceiue, the diuine power of God to be ſuch, that hée can pull downe Princes from their thrones, and reſtore them againe at his pleaſure, as ſometimes he did by <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadnezar</hi> and others, to the ſetting foorth of his glorie and power.</p>
               <p>Now was it hard about the Month of May, when as the fields and woods were deckt with <hi>Floras</hi> broode, and on each ſpray ſate louely birds, reſounding heauenly harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. The pretie Nitingall, ſetting her ſpeckled breaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a bryer, regarded not fond <hi>Terius</hi> foule deſire, but chaunted forth her pleaſant ditties. When as the King and Quéene, accompanied with a ſmall traine of Lordes and Ladies whom they loued, one morning early ſtale forth of the Court ſecretly, to diſport the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the forreſt, which was hard adioyning vnto the Citty walls, where they had not long remained, beholding the broad-ſhaded Okes, and ſtately loftie Pines, before that a company of Out-lawes,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:4"/> who were baniſhed the Kingdome of Fraunce, had eſpyed them, and ſéeing they were no better prouided, ſet on them. Where one might haue beheld the Quéene and her Ladies ſo affrighted with this ſudden accident, fling vp &amp; downe, ſome hiding themſelues in one buſh, ſome in another. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againe béeing more timerous, ſuncke downe where they ſtoode, not béeing able to flie away. But all was one, flie or tarry, for béeing purſued, they were all taken, and brought backe, ſauing onely the Quéene, who béeing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forwards with the wings of feare, made ſuch haſt that ſhée eſcaped them all, béeing ſo appointed by the prouidence of God.</p>
               <p>The King likewiſe &amp; Noblemen béeing amazed at this vnlooked for euent, knew not well ſuddenly what to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but in the end, ſéeing no other remedy, reſolued to defend themſelues as well as they might. The King being at that time one of the moſt accompliſhed Knights in all Europe, layd on ſuch blowes amongſt them, that hee made an euident ſhew that hee was determined to ſell his life at an extreame déere rate. But beeing vnarmed, and hauing no other weapon but his ſword, and all his company bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine out-right ſauing two, who were likewiſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wounded, was forſt perforce to yéelde to theyr pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe mercy: who hauing obtaind victory, ſtript them all, as well Lords as Ladies of their coyne, and abilliments which were ought worth. And binding thoſe whom they thought might any waies worke them diſpleaſure, as by rayſing power to purſue them, or vnbinding their fellows, they determined ſpéedily to depart towards the Sea coaſt, where ſome of their company remained, with two ſmall Barks, wherewith they croſt the ſeas. But as they were ready to depart, it came into one of their mindes, that ſome of them whom they had robbed, might peraduenture be ſuch perſons, for whoſe raunſome, they might get more coyne then all theyr booty was worth: wherefore demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of one of the Ladies who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had bound, what they were, was giuen to vnderſtand, that hee who made the
<pb facs="tcp:150602:5"/> greateſt reſiſtance was the King, the other two which were liuing, both noble men of his Court. Then calling to his mind, the great hate betwéene the ſaid King, and <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fory</hi> Duke of Holland, determined if he could, to cary him with him, and to preſent him to the Duke, of whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to receiue ſome great reward. Wherefore intreating his fellowes, who knew not who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had robbed, ſo grant him ſo much fauour, as to permit him to haue that Knight for his priſoner, in regard as knowing him heeretofore in Fraunce, fayning that there he had doone great deſpight to a friend of his, in reuenge whereof hee would deliuer him into his hands, whom he knew would kéepe him in eternal priſon for his former offence. Nowe if they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to grant this vnto him, hee would ſéeke for no other part of their bootie.</p>
               <p>They all béeing more gréedy of pray then of priſoners, who they thought might rather be a charge, then profit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, were content to graunt vnto his requeſt. Who preſently went and vnbound the King, and ſo led him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards theyr ſhipping. And hauing winde at will, preſently wayed Ancor, and ſet into the Sea, where wee will leaue them for awhile, and returne to the Quéene, who by her ſwift flight, miſt the hands of the thieues, but fell into as great or greater ill. For whilſt the King and the other Lords held the thieues ſomewhat ſhort, by defending themſelues, as is before declared, the fearefull Quéene fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the wood for ſafety, ſtrayed two and fro ſhee wiſt not whether. At length, béeing wearied with running, and fainting ſtill with feare, ſhée ſate her downe vnder a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper buſh, to refreſh her ſelfe, where after ſhee had awhile reſted her ſelfe, ſhée began to call to mind, and conſider in what great danger ſhée had left her Lord &amp; huſband, then reprouing herſelfe, for that ſhe had not rather made choyce to haue ſtayed and ended her dayes with him, then thus to haue romed ſhe wiſt not whether. Then riſing vp, ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to haue returned to the ſame place where ſhe left them fighting, but ſtrayed further, ſo that tracing and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing
<pb facs="tcp:150602:5"/> vp and downe the wood, ſhee ſpent the whole day to her no ſmall griefe. And now darke night hauing ſpred her ſable mantle ouer the face of the earth, the ſorrowfull Quéene, not knowing what to doe, or whether to goe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take vp her lodging for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night, vnder a broade branched Oake, faſt by a fountaines ſide, wheras the wild beaſts of the Forreſt did commonly reſort to drinke, where good Lady ſhée was forced to content herſelfe with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry pittance, teares béeing her daintieſt diſh, whereon ſhée fedde, ſometimes exclayming on cruell fortune, whom ſhée accuſed to haue brought her into theſe miſeries: then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently her huſbands portrature ſéemed to appeare vnto her minde, whom ſhe thought to be murdred by thoſe robbers, which was ſuch a griefe vnto her, that many times ſhe was minded to haue ſlaine her ſelfe, had not God mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued her to a further ſetting forth of his glory.</p>
               <p>Thus paſt ſhée away moſt part of the night with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and lamentations, vntill ſuch time that <hi>Somnus</hi> with his leaden wings ſeaſed her eye-lids, and cauſed her for a while to ſlumber. In which ſléepe, ſhee thought an Angell ſent from God, being clothed all in white rayment, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her, ſaying, Bee of good hart and feare not, for theſe croſſes which now are come vpon thée, the Lord hath ſent to proue thée with all, and therefore it behooueth thée to beare it patiently, vntill ſuch time as the Lord ſhall eaſe thée of them. As for the King thy huſband he liueth, but yet in bands, and ſhall doe ſtill, vntill ſuch time as the childe that now is in thy wombe, ſhall be his deliuerer, whom thou at his birth ſhalt name <hi>Euordanus,</hi> this nowe am I ſent to tell thee, becauſe thou ſhouldeſt not diſpayre.</p>
               <p>The Quéene héereat awaked out of her ſlumber, and looking about if ſhe might ſée any body, but could not, then perceiuing it to be a dreame, or viſion, meruailed what it might ſignifie, &amp; was greatly troubled with deuiſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſo that all the night after ſhee could take no reſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinking of her huſband, and ſometimes what the childes deliuerance might meane, at length determined to
<pb facs="tcp:150602:6"/> referre all to the mercifull prouidence of God. Thus ſits ſhée poore ſorrowfull Lady, till ſuch time as by the ſinging of the chéerefull Larke, &amp; by the roaring of the wild beaſts, ſhée was preparing to forſake Dame <hi>Thetis</hi> lodging, and that nights ſable mantle was changed into a hoary gray. When loe, as was their wont, the ſauage beaſts came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the well to drink, there did ſhee with feare beholde the ſtatelie Vnicorne, with the cruell Tiger, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roaring Beare, and gaudy Panther, the bellowing Bull, &amp; foming Bore, the rauening Wolfe, and craftie Foxe, with diuers more, which put her in ſuch feare, that ſhe had thought preſently to haue béen deuoured, when ſalling on her knées, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp her hands, ſhe ſaid theſe or ſuch like words.</p>
               <p>O moſt mercifull Lord God, I doe here acknowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy diuine maieſtie, my manifolde and innumerable ſins committed againſt thy diuine maieſty both in thought, word, and déed, O Lord I am not worthy ſo much as once to looke vp to heauen, much leſſe to receiue any thing at thy hands O Lord. Yet mercifull Father, truſting in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thy déerely beloued ſonne, our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, I come vnto thée in his name, crauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of all my ſinnes and iniquities. And further, O Lord God, I humbly beſéech thée to ſaue and deliuer mée, from this preſent danger, and perrill of my wretched life, O Lord bow downe thy heauenly eye, and behold mee thy wofull handmaide, and likewiſe this poore infant that is within my wombe, defend it, O Lord, and grant that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the viſion which thou by thy holy Angell haſt ſhewed mee, it may liue to ſet foorth thy glory and power, and in the end, when it ſhall be thy bleſſed will, to call vs out of this wretched vale of wickednes, thou wilt receiue and place vs in thy Celeſtiall kingdome, whether O Lord for thy ſonnes ſake bring vs I beſéech thée.</p>
               <p>Theſe, or ſuch like were the words, which ſhe diſtreſſed Lady then vttered: when behold a mightie ſurious Lyon came ruſhing out of the wood towards her, bringing in his mouth a cake of Bread, which he moſt gently layd downe
<pb facs="tcp:150602:6"/> at her féete, fawning vpon her, as if of long time he had bin acquainted with her, and would not depart from her. At length, ſomewhat to recomfort herſelfe, then ſmoothing his rough briſtles with her tender hand, ſhe made much of him laying his head on her lap, wherat he ſéemed to take great content. Then taking vp the cake of bread which hee had brought her, and giuing thanks vnto God, imagining as ſometimes in the wildernes hee had ſent Rauens to feede the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> ſo likewiſe had hee now ſent the Lion to comfort and bring her foode, ſhe refreſhed therwith her hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſtomacke.

Or as when the angry Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi> gréeuing at the quiet paſſage of the poore vanquiſht Troians, deſired <hi>Eolus</hi> to ſinke them in the ſea: ſo fared it with them, by reaſon that the ſeas on all ſides béeing ſo aſſaulted of the windes, did ſo cruelly rage and ſtorme, that ſometimes theyr ſmall Barks did ſéeme to touch the very clowdes, and preſently againe were throwne downe vnto the ſands, euery man imagining that to be the laſt houre of theyr liues.

               <p>The ſtorme béeing thus broken vp, and the Sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning againe to lighten the earth with his ſplendant beames, the weather-beathen Marriners looking abroade for theyr comfort, eſpied the Land, which after they had a while with ioy beheld, they made to be the Land of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Who then ſo glad as <hi>Martinus,</hi> for ſo was hée called which had the King to his priſoner, for whom he hoped ere long to receiue ſuch a ſumme of money, as for euer ſhould make him rich: the King on the other ſide was in as great perplexity, knowing that they were arriued on the coaſt of his greateſt enemy, yet comforting himſelfe ſomewhat with the hope of not beeing knowne, as alſo of not knowing <hi>Martinus</hi> meaning, he ſhewed himſelfe the more chéerefull.

               <p>So departed <hi>Martinus</hi> with his priſoner, whom he ſwore ſo continue true vnto him: as fearing his eſcape, being to trauell but they two together, but the King being in his enemies country, durſt not make himſelfe knowne, which he muſt needes, if he had made any reſiſtance. Thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling on together towards <hi>Hanſtance,</hi> they ariued there at ſuch time, as the bluſhing ſunne plucking in his ſmiling beames, making his ſteedes to mende their wonted place, and plunging downe into the Ocean ſtreames, there in
<pb facs="tcp:150602:8"/> the frothy waues did hide his face, leauing the earth coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with nights darkſome ſhade: wherefore that night they tooke vp their lodging, <hi>Martinus</hi> learning of his haoſt, how Duke <hi>Griffory</hi> hauing euer ſince ſhe marriage of the King of Denmarke, and the faire Lady <hi>Alliſon</hi> of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> giuen ouer all pleaſure, was withdrawne from his Court into the Country, ſome eight miles diſtance from the Cittie: where hauing built a lodge in a maruilous ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie place, hee paſſed the time in mellancholly humors, ſomewhiles playing on the Lute ſome mournefull ditties, otherwhiles, ingrauing in the trees on the ground Verſes and Sonnets, féeding his humors with ſuch vaine toies, to the great griefe of all his ſubiects: and how in all that time he neuer had ſufferd any one to come into his preſence, or to ſpeake with him, ſauing a ſmale company of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, which remained there with him. When <hi>Martinus</hi> had heard all this, he determined y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day to goe thether, and to make knowne vnto him thoſe things, which ſhould ſoone put him out of his melancholy dumpes. The next morning very early he was riſſen vp, and comming to the King, told him how that hee had ſome occaſion of buſines in the Country, which would cauſe him to be away a day or two, wherefore hee was determined in the meane time, leauing him behind him, to cauſe him once more to ſweare vnto him, to remaine vntill his returne, which if hee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that then he would commit him vnto ſome priſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cittie, whereas hee ſhould bee alwaies foorth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at his pleaſure. The King liſtning attentiuely vnto his ſpeech, was driuen into a thouſand imaginations, not knowing what was beſt for him to doe, at length conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his former oath, which rather then he would violate, he would chuſe to indure any death whatſoeuer, ſo much did he eſtéeme of his Kingly oath: hee anſwered him thus. I knowe not what your meaning may bee, in this ſort to doubt my former promiſe, and to goe about by a new oath to aſſure your ſelfe of me: if to ſet me to ranſome, I heere fréely proffer my ſelfe to goe a long with you into any place,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:9"/> out of this accurſed region, and there to remaine, vntill ſuch time that the ſame bee payed vnto you, although it ſhould amounte vnto an hundred thouſand pounds, rather then that you ſhould deliuer me, into the hands of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of this accurſed Country, who is my mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p>Nay, nay, replied <hi>Martinus,</hi> being blinded with couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and hoping for a greater ſumme of monie: there is no ſuch matter ment, but I haue not farre off a friend, whoſe councell I minde to followe heerein: in the meane time chuſe whether you will remaine in priſon, or vppon your oath. The King ſéeing no remedie, ſware vnto him againe to continue his true priſoner, although it coſt him his life.</p>
               <p>Then departed <hi>Martinus,</hi> towards the Dukes lodge, where béeing arriued, and deſiring conference with his grace, touching ſuch matters as néerely concerned him, he was at length brought into a garden, in forme much like vnto an endleſſe laborinth, ſo many were the diuers and ſundry walkes and allies, couered with many kinds of trees, which yeilded ſuch a cloſe ſhadow, that the Sunne with his ſplendant beames could ſcarſe ſhinne through: and paſſing thus from one walke into another, he came at length where the Duke ſate in an Arbor of Baies, beeing clothed all in blacke, ſignifying his great ſorrowe which he ſuſtained, and hauing a Lute in his hand, was playing a mornefull dittie, which he euen then had framed, to which <hi>Martinus</hi> and his guide a while liſtned, vnſéene by reaſon of the thicknes of the Arbor.</p>
               <p>At length comming néerer, and with reuerence ſaluting his excellencie, <hi>Martinus</hi> ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>Moſt mightie and puiſſant Prince, I cannot but woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that you who heeretofore, were wont to ſpend your time in moſt honorable exerciſes, as Tilt and Turnie, and following hautie déedes of Chiualrie, ſhould ſo giue your ſelfe ouer vnto this ſolitarie kind of life, neither regarding your owne eſtate, nor the eſtate of your louing ſubiects and Country: which would ſpend their very liues to worke
<pb facs="tcp:150602:9"/> your content. But if I bee not deceaued, this ſtrange hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor wherewith you are poſſeſt, procéedeth from contrarie occaſions, the one is the extreame hate you beare vnto the King of Denmarke, the other ouer much loue towards the beautifull Quéene his wife, not knowing with your ſelfe what way to be reuenged of him, nor how to regaine her loue. But ſuppoſe moſt mighty Prince, I ſhould worke the meanes of your reuenge, by deliuering him into your hands, would not it content you? yea would you not more reioyce thereof, then to haue gained the greateſt Cittie in Chriſtendome, and likewiſe reward him, that ſhould effect the ſame to his content: ſpeake O worthy Duke, were not theſe the occaſions of thy griefe, and would not this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be the chiefeſt medicine to ſeaſe thy ſorrowe.</p>
               <p>Scarce were theſe laſt words vttered, when the Duke ſtarting vp, and ſtaring him in the face, as one wakned out of ſound ſléepe, thus replied. Friend, whatſoeuer thou art that ſéekeſt by a fayned and filed tale, to driue me out of my ſad paſſions; knowe that to ieſt with Princes is not tollerable: But if thou canſt performe, that whereof thou haſt made ſhowe of, I will not be ſlacke in rewarding thée for thy paines, though thou ſhouldeſt demaunde halfe my Dukedome. Therefore tell me by what meanes this may be accompliſhed: then effect and bring it to paſſe, and I will reward thée to thy owne content. Worthy Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Martinus,</hi> if I performe it not, then let my head bee ſtriken from my ſhoulders, conditionally that if I doe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into thy hands, that vnhappie King, I may haue for my reward the Citty of <hi>Hanſtance</hi> during my life, with the profits thereof: and this confirme vnto mee before your Nobilitie, and then I will deliuer him into your hands, within this eight daies next comming.</p>
               <p>The Duke being filled with ioy, with this his ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable newes, conſented vnto whatſoeuer he demanded, and calling for a Knight which was néereſt vnto him, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to ſommon his Counſell the next day, to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to heare a matter of importance, which he would ſhow
<pb facs="tcp:150602:10"/> vnto them: which was foorthwith accompliſhed, euery one the next day at their houre appointed, beeing ready in the Counſell chamber, to heare what ſhould be their Princes will: euery one greatly meruailing what ſoden motion, was entred in his head, conſidering that by the ſpace of a yéere before, he had neuer conferred with them of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no nor once ſuffered them to come into his preſence. They being as I haue ſayd gathered together in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell chamber, the Duke leading <hi>Martinus</hi> by the hand, came vnto them, where he declared his intent, with the promiſe of <hi>Martinus:</hi> all which was conſented vnto by them, hoping thereby to haue their Prince in his former eſtate of content: Aſſuring vnto <hi>Martinus</hi> vnder their hands and ſeales, that whatſoeuer the Duke had made promiſe of, they would ſee it performed, ſo ſoone as hée ſhould deliuer the King of Denmarke into their hands. Héere will I leaue them to tell of the great griefe, made through all Denmarke, for the loſſe of their King and Quéene.</p>

               <p>Thus hauing determined, they armed themſelues, to the number of thrée thouſand, Knights and Gentlemen, and being mounted on their horſes, they tooke the way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

               <p>The Lord <hi>Gwaltero</hi> hauing his wounds bound vp, and being ſomewhat refreſhed and reuiued with ſuch reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, as ſome of the companie had brought with them, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, how that walking to take the aire, and to view thoſe pleaſant ſhades, they were ſodenly and vnawares ſet on by forty théeues or Outlawes, whom by their apparrell and ſpéech, they iudged to be frenchmen, where defending themſelues as well as they might, were in the end thus ouercome and wounded: and as for the King, after they had bound vs and were departing away, hauing before ſtripped vs of the wealth we had about vs, they returned and tooke him with them, towards the ſea-ſide. But of the Quéene, we knowe no certainty, for whilſt we were figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhe fled into the wood, with the reſt of the Ladies, who were all brought back againe ſaue the Quéene only, by ſome of the Outlawes who perſued them: more I knowe not, but feare leaſt they likewiſe hapned on her, and haue

               <p>When Sir <hi>Henault</hi> had heard this diſcourſe made by the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> he was ſo grieued inwardly, that with extreame ſorrowe he fell from his horſe in a trance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought againe to himſelfe, ſéeing all things were to be followed according to the occaſion and time, firſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, ſome part of his companie to conuaie the Lords and Ladies to the Court, whereas they that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded might find helpe for to cure the ſame: and they likewiſe that were ſlaine, might euery one haue buriall according to their eſtates: himſelfe in the meane ſpace being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a hundred Knights, would followe after the théeues, hoping that if they were not put to ſea before their comming, not only to reſcue the King, but alſo to giue them ſuch a reward as for euer ſhould bee an example, to thoſe who ſhould goe about to attempt the like.

               <head>CHAP. IIII. Of the generall lamentation that was made throughout all the Kingdome, and how that after a councell held for the gouerning thereof, the Knights and noble men tooke on them the ſearch of the King.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next day, no ſooner had darke night ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his leaue, and that the day began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Eaſt, but Sir <hi>Henault</hi> with the reſt of his company, were mounted on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, taking their way towards the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cittie of <hi>Maiance,</hi> where béeing arriued, they found the Citty all full of heauines, by reaſon of the late newes, which at their comming was ſo much the more augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being returned without any certaine knowledge what was become of the King and Quéene. There might you haue ſéene the true diſcription of ſorrow, not in one onelie creature, but in generall through the whole Cittie: ſome fell to ſhutting vp their doores and windowes, as minding for very griefe to incloſe themſelues priſoners in their own houſes, ſhunning the day light, which had giuen light to thoſe Robbers, who had diſpoyled them of their ioy and comfort. Others againe clad in blacke mournfull attire, with their chéeks be ſpred with teares, which like ſtreames trickled downe from the fountaines of their eyes, went vp and downe lamenting and bewailing the loſſe of theyr ſo louing and gracious Prince. The late coſtly ſhewes, and ſtately Pagants, were turned into ſadde obiects: yea, no noyſe was heard through the whole Cittie, but wéeping and lamentation, ſo that the ſorrow ſuſtained by the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians, for the loſſe of their chiefe Champion <hi>Hector,</hi> when by the Gréeks, at the commaundement of cruell <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> he was thrée times dragd about their Cittie walls, béeing before hand cowardly ſlaine with his accurſed Speare, was not to bee compared with this of <hi>Maiance.</hi> The graue and modeſt Matrons, were ſéene with theyr
<pb facs="tcp:150602:12"/> garments rent, and their haire diſperſed about their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in moſt dolefull manner to repayre to the Temples, where before the moſt Higheſt, they poured foorth theyr prayers for their Soueraigne, bathing themſelues with the teares which fell from their eyes. The young damſels pleaſant ſongs, which with cléere and chéerfull breſts they were wont to record, were now turned into ſad &amp; mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ditties, bewailing the loſſe of their Countries protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Yea, ſo generall was the gréefe vnto all manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, that for the ſpace of fortie dayes together, there was neither ſhops opened, nor any wares or merchandiſe ſolde in their markets. So that the towne, which was wont to be ſo filled with all ſorts of people, now ſéemed in a manner to be voyde &amp; deſolate, none, or very few ſéene at any time to walke in the ſtréets. Neither was the griefe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try any leſſe, yea throughout the whole kingdome: ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally was he beloued of all his ſubiects, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not onely a iuſt Prince, but alſo a louing Father to his Country, alwaies defending the poore from the oppreſſion of the rich, and the deſolate widdowes and Orphans, from the violence of thoſe, who by any meanes ſought to wrong them.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> as we haue before ſaid, béeing returned to <hi>Maiance,</hi> cauſed foorthwith ſome ſmall Barkes to be well manned and ſent foorth after the Pyrats, with commaund not onely to ſcoure their owne Coaſt, but alſo to purſue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the borders of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> where they tooke many, but could not méet with any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they ſought for. Then calling a generall Counſell of all the Nobility and Péeres of the Land, where after a long &amp; learned Oration by him pronounced, deſcribing vnto them, the fickle and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate wherein their Country now ſtoode, by reaſon of this ſudden and vnlooked for alteration of crooked For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, with the mutabilitie of the minds of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe natures are alwaies to liſten after nouelties. which things being conſidered, it could not chuſe but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnpoſſible, to kéepe the Common-wealth in ſafetie:
<pb facs="tcp:150602:13"/> without ſome certaine forme of gouernment to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Deſiring all of them to bend and ioyne theyr willing minds together, to deuiſe ſome courſe or meanes for the ſame, vntill the King might againe be heard of and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. Which hee thought could by no meanes better be effected, then by a generall ſearch made by a choſen num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Knights, who ſhould trauell through all the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and kingdoms of Chriſtendome, and elſe-where, as by them it ſhould be thought fit and conuenient: of which number, he himſelfe God willing intended to be one, who would either finde him out, or end his dayes in the ſearch.</p>
               <p>This his ſpéech was liſtned vnto of all, but eſpeciallie applauded and commended by the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Menew,</hi> who as then were indifferently recouered of their wounds, which they receiued at the loſſe of theyr King: and béeing both young and valerous, eſpeciallie <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> who was then the abſolute beſt Knight in all the kingdome of Denmarke, hoped by this meanes not onely to find out their King, if ſo be he liued, but alſo to winne to themſelues eternall renowne, by their haughtie déedes of Chiualrie, which they hoped to obtaine in ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where their fortunes ſhould conduct them. But as for the gouernment of the Common-wealth, in theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, they thought none more fit then Sir <hi>Henault</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who béeing both ſage and diſcréete, and alſo béeing as we haue ſaid before, Lorde Treaſurer, &amp; alwaies in great fauour with their late King, had in a maner the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the affaires of the Kingdome in his owne hands, by which meanes, as they ſuppoſed, he knew how, better then any other, to continue the ſame in the former eſtate, which would be farre better then to alter the ſame, by any other order of gouernment.</p>
               <p>This their opinion was held for currant of many, and conſented vnto by moſt of thoſe that were preſent, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired no alteration, but thought their former manner of rule to be beſt, and without fault.</p>
               <p>But as there is no man ſo vertuous, but ſhall haue ſome
<pb facs="tcp:150602:13"/> that will enuy at his goodnes, eſpecially great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men, who no ſooner grow into the good liking and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the people, be it by neuer ſo iuſt or well deſerued occaſion, (yea though by him onely the Common-wealth hath béen in a manner preſerued and defended from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſiue power of their enemies, (yet ſhall you haue ſome, like dogges in a manger, that will neither doo good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor willingly heare of others well dooings,) beeing prickt forwards with enuy, will not ſtick to turne any his good deſeruings into euill, and all their counſels, be they neuer ſo profitable to the Common-wealth, they will goe about to perſwade, that it is rather to benefit &amp; rayſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, then to doe good to their Countries: yea further, let them accompliſh any notable péece of ſeruice for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they will not be afraide to whiſper into mens eares, that it was doone but for vaine glory.) Euen ſuch there were in this Counſell, who not onely for enuie, diſliked the choyſe which the Lord <hi>Gwaltero</hi> and the reſt had made, but alſo diſliked of the ſearch which Sir <hi>Henault</hi> had motioned for the ſéeking of the King, alleaging that by making ſuch a queſt, they ſhould not onely diſpoyle themſelues of theyr chiefe Captaines and leaders, but alſo leaue theyr Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try naked, and ready for euery inuaſion of the enemy, when it would be too late to call home thoſe for theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence whom they ſhould not know where to find. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thought it better to ſend forth Embaſſadors into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Nations, thereby hoping to gaine knowledge, what was become of him: thinking that if the Out-lawes had kept him aliue, that then they had ſold him to ſome Prince, who would be content to put him to raunſome. Others held, that to ſend foorth ſpyes, which by diligent inquirie might heare of him, would be the beſt courſe. Thus diuers men were of diuers minds, ſitting a long while in counſell to no end, neither determining any order for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common-wealth, nor meanes to find out their King and Quéene. But at length, by the meanes of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Maiance,</hi> who deſired change and alteration,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:14"/> they grew to determine of their gouernment, which ſhould be in this manner following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they ſhould chuſe of the moſt ſufficienſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and Laitie of the Realme, the number of ſixe-ſcore, out of which number by lot they ſhould chuſe tenne, and of the Clergie thirtie, out of which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber likewiſe they ſhould chuſe two by lot, ſo that of the Nobility there ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tenne, and of the Clergie two, which twelue ſo elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould haue the gouernment of the whole kingdom for a yéere, and at the yéeres end, to giue vp an account vnto the other ſixe-ſcore and eighteene, of the imployment of the treaſure belonging to the Crowne: and then other twelue to be choſen in the ſame manner, for the next yere. And this order and manner of gouernment to be kept inuiolate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as they ſhould heare ſome certaine newes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Kings death, or returne. To this they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, ſetting thereto their hands &amp; ſeales, preſently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choyſe of thoſe whoſe happe ſhould be firſt to gouerne this their new deuiſed ſtate. The Lots béeing caſt, the firſt twelue to whom the gouernment lighted, was of the Clergie, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Maiance,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delſtoe:</hi> and of the Nobilitie, the Duke of <hi>Louenborge,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Newmiſter,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>Harding,</hi> the Count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> the Countie of <hi>Mildorpe,</hi> the County of <hi>Opencade,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Londen,</hi> the Lord <hi>Itzenho,</hi> the Lorde of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Rensborge.</hi> Theſe twelue, according to former agréement, tooke on them the gouernment of the kingdome, firſt ſetting all things in quiet within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and making diuers lawes and ſtatutes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation thereof. And then made preparation for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of the ſame, if ſo be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any neighbor Prince ſhould now in the alteration of their gouernment, make any war or inuaſion vppon them, thereby not to be taken vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. They therefore fortified diuers Caſtles, and ſtrong Holds vppon the borders of the Kingdome, repairing thoſe that were weake, and erecting new where they thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny néede to be, placing garriſons in them all, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence
<pb facs="tcp:150602:14"/> thereof. Likewiſe they tooke order, for the defence and ſure kéeping of the Country of <hi>Flaunders</hi> in their ſubiection, fearing leaſt vppon the report of the loſſe of the King and Quéene, there might be ſome alteration mooued, either by ſome neighbour Potentate, or the inhabitants themſelues, who at that time were giuen altogether, to deſire change and alteration.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt all theſe diſcourſes wee muſt not forget the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> the Lord <hi>Menew,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> whoſe heroicke mindes not being able to bee contained within the confines of Denmarke, miſſing their onely comfort and ſolace, their noble Prince, whoſe preſence was more déere to them, then any thing in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: prouided according to their former determinations, to trauell in his queſt throughout the whole world, but that they would either find him out, or heare ſome certaine newes of him, which being made knowne, to diuers other Lords and Knights, there were to the number of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, all of the minde, bent either to find him out, or neuer to returne. Thus euery one in the beſt manner they could, made preperation for their iourney, fitting themſelues both with armor, and ſtore of money for their néedefull expences in their trauell. And being all in a readines to depart, they deuided themſelues, ſome into one Country, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, appointing where many times to méete, being in ſtrange Countries, where wee will leaue them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what befell to the King and <hi>Martinus,</hi> being in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Country, as is before mentioned.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. How King <hi>Fredericke,</hi> was deliuered by <hi>Martinus,</hi> into the the hands of <hi>Griffory,</hi> by whom hee was impriſoned, and how <hi>Martinus</hi> by the Duke was afterward put to death.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard before, how <hi>Martinus</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed with <hi>Griffory</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the good King <hi>Fredericke,</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence whereof, he ſhould haue for tearme of his life, the Cittie of <hi>Hanſtance,</hi> withall the cuſtomes and profits thereof.</p>
               <p>The next day after this concluſion, the Duke going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him to <hi>Hanſtance,</hi> where being ariued, was by <hi>Martinus</hi> brought into the Burgeſſes houſe, where he left the King, who according to his oath he found there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, little fearing that which ſuddenly hapned vnto him, for <hi>Martinus</hi> comming vnto him, and taking him by the hand, as if hee would haue conferred with him about his raunſome, brought him at length into a chamber, whereas he had left the Duke, accompanied with ſome few of his nobillitie, vnto whom <hi>Martinus</hi> ſpake as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Moſt high and mighty Prince, according vnto my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſe made vnto your excellencie, I héere before theſe your nobillity, deliuer vp into your hands, this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and vnhappie King of Denmarke, of whom you may now at any time, be fully and ſufficiently reuenged, of any former wrong by him committed againſt you, or of any diſpleaſure, which worthily you haue conceaued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and likewiſe ſo clip his wings, for euer héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after being able, to doe you the leaſt offence whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>When the Duke had heard him ſpeake this his pleaſing, and to him moſt delightfull ſpeech, ſcarce ſuffring him to make his concluſion, hauing alſo in the meane time throughly viewed the King, whom by diuers ſignes he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily knew to be the ſame, he could ſcarce content himſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:15"/> but would immediatly haue ſlaine him with his owne hands, ſo deadly was the hate he bare him, and ſuch the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuillitie of his churliſh and reuengfull nature: yet being ſtopped by ſome of his nobilitie from killing him, hee fell out into theſe or ſuch like rayling ſpeeches. O thou moſt accurſed and vild caitife, whom were it not (that I meane to put thée to more extreame paine &amp; torments,) I would with theſe my hands, rent that deteſtable body of thine to peeces, and with my téeth teare and gnaw the fleſh from thy bones, ſo endleſſe is my malice againſt thée, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thy wrongs and villanies committed, which cauſeth me to muſe and inuent, what or how many kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I might inflict vpon thée. But would to God that diſloyall ſtrumpet, that infernall Quéene, the cauſer of all my miſeries, yea ſhe whoſe bewitching beauty, thou ſo much and with ſuch a gréedineſſe haſt deſired, yea and by thy comurations, and other thy deteſtable and execrable meanes, thou haſt hetherunto to thy content inioyed: O that ſhe were héere preſent, to behold and take part of thoſe continuall paines and torments, the which not only for the hate I beare thée, but alſo to bee reuenged on her, for her moſt odious, whoriſh, and execrable diſſimulation towards me, I meane to inflict vppon thy wretched carkas.</p>
               <p>The good King being no longer able to forbeare, theſe inhumane and oprobrious reuilings, proffred him by his curriſh and ſpightfull enemie, replied in this ſort: <hi>Griffory</hi> I cannot but muſe, how God hauing indued thée, with reaſon and vnderſtanding like vnto other men, that thou notwithſtanding, ſhouldeſt abound in vicious, wicked, and deteſtable conditions aboue all other men, which canſt not be content with the miſerie, which thou ſéeſt me brought into, being thy priſoner, and at thy diſpoſition, to be either kept or ranſomed, wrought by the moſt baſe &amp; odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meanes that might be, yea after ſuch a ſort, that the berieſt Infidell vnder the heauens, would not ſo much as once haue gone about or imagined, but alſo now (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) to all humanitie, reuileſt me with ſuch oprobrious
<pb facs="tcp:150602:16"/> ſpéeches, whom héeretofore thou durſt not to looke me in the face for feare, and alſo reuile at her, whom neither thy ſelfe, nor no man liuing is able to touch with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leaſt crime whatſoeuer, and that would I make good againſt ſhée, and thrée of the beſt of thy Knights with my body, were I at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, hauing horſe and armor. Tis true, tis true, replied the Duke, we knowe your vallor to be great, but we will ſoone abate that your hote courage, and place you where your Goddeſſe whom you ſo much eſtéeme, ſhall neither haue power, nor meanes to helpe you.</p>
               <p>Doe thy worſt replied the King, and ſith it is the will of God to inflict this puniſhment vpon me, I will indeuor my ſelfe with patience, to indure what torments ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall happen, hoping in the world to come, to inioy therefore eternall bleſſedneſſe: but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time thinke not thou, but that thou maiſt fall in like miſhap, and that I haue yet remaining in the Kingdome of Denmarke ſuch Subiects, that when they ſhall knowe of this my ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and thy crueltie, will not leaue bearing Armes, till ſuch time they ſhal haue layd waſt, this thy accurſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not leauing thée any Towne, or Fort to hide thy ſelfe, from their reuengefull ſwords: wherefore aduiſe thee, and determine either to ſet me at libertie, or otherwiſe expect thoſe euils, which will ſurely fall on thy Country. If thou conſent to my inlargement, for my ranſome thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a whole million of gold, which ſhall bee payed thée foorthwith out of my treaſurie.</p>
               <p>No, no, replied <hi>Griffory,</hi> thy gold is but droſſe, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke in me that content, which my hart ſhall inioy by thy impriſonment, neither doe I feare thy power which thou ſo much vaunteſt of, for thou ſhalt ſée, and that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I will not onely poſſeſſe my ſelfe of thy darlings County of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> but alſo by the ſtrength of this right arme, in deſpight of all thy power, Crowne my ſelfe King of the Kingdome of <hi>Danſke,</hi> whilſt thou in the meane time, ſhall lie rotting thy bones in my priſon. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turning about to a Knight of his, named Sir <hi>Ragdand,</hi> hee willed
<pb facs="tcp:150602:16"/> him to conuay the vnhappie King priſoner vnto his Caſtle of <hi>Coruew,</hi> and there to put him into the dungion of the ſayd Caſtle, and to alowe him euery day, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his moſt wretched life, a quart of water, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of bread, made of the courſeſt branne, thinking this, that continually pining away by reaſon of his courſe faire, would be a farre greater paine and torment vnto him, then any preſent death whatſoeuer. Likewiſe for the more ſure keeping of him, hee ordained a gard of fifty Knights, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to bee within the Caſtle, who ſhould ſée that no Knight ſhould enter therein. This Caſtle of <hi>Coruew,</hi> was of meruailous ſtrength, inuironed about with déepe ditches, and mighty heigh walls, and had but only one way in, which was ouer a drawe bridge, the which was alwaies defended by ten of the ſayd fifty Knights, fiue at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one end, and fiue at the other, this gard grew at length to a cuſtome, by reaſon of the hundred Knights of Denmarke, which went in ſearch of their King, and was deuiſed only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap and impriſon them, as you may reade towards the latter end of this booke. Héere now will we leaue the woful King incloſed in a miſerable priſon, bewailing his croſſe fortune, where hee paſſed away many a yeare, &amp; although his fare was as we haue ſayd before both courſe and ſhort, yet did God ſo bleſſe him, that he continued alwaies heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſtronge of body, neuer grieued with any kind of ſicknes, ſauing onely diſcontentedneſſe of minde, which with patience he much delayed, &amp; returne we to ſpeake of <hi>Martinus,</hi> (who had not long after the impriſonment of the King, quietly inioyed the cittie of <hi>Hanſtance,</hi> withall the profits thereof before granted him, to the extreame griefe of the chiefeſt of the Cittie, who diſdained much to bee in ſubiection to ſo baſe a perſon,) for the Duke, ſome eight daies after poſſeſſion deliuered, fell in conſideration with himſelfe, of the great benefit which hee had loſt, by giuing away the chiefe Citty in his Dukedome, deuiſed which way he might with his honor recouer the ſame againe: at length hauing reſolued with himſelfe, he brought it thus to
<pb facs="tcp:150602:17"/> paſſe.</p>
               <p>One day béeing with diuers of his Nobility, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> béeing in company, the Duke fained himſelfe to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merry, and in his mirth, for his further content, deſired <hi>Martinus</hi> to declare, how hee hapned to take <hi>Frederick</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. <hi>Martinus</hi> not diſtruſting any thing, began to make a large repetition, beginning with his former life in France, then the cauſe and manner of his baniſhment, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuing in Denmarke, with their robbery and murder, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Forreſt of <hi>Maiance,</hi> with their cruell ſtorme ſuſtained at Sea, as is before declared, by which they were put on that Coaſt, and laſtly, the profer of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound by the King, which hee refuſed, onely to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Duke. All which when <hi>Griffory</hi> had attentiuelie liſtned vnto, hée ſuddenly ſtart vp from the place where hée ſate, commaunding the ſtanders by to lay hands on <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſaying that it was not lawfull to ſuffer ſuch a one, who had ſo many waies deſerued death, as by his owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did appeare, neither to liue, nor to be accepted into the ſocietie of men: wherefore he willed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth-with to leade him to the place of execution. Which when <hi>Martinus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and ſaw that the Tyrant was fully minded to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, whatſoeuer he had ſaid, hee fell downe on his knees, deſiring mercy, and offering for the ſafegard of his life, to redeliuer his right of the Citty of <hi>Hanſtance.</hi> But hee who neuer was acquainted with mercy or compaſſion, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting if he ſhould pardon him his life, the whole world would condemne him of iniuſtice: and ſéeing he might as well by his death as his life inioy his will, aunſwered, that by the Law hee had deſerued to die, and hee béeing appointed by God, to be a miniſter of iuſtice, could doo no leſſe then cauſe the lawes to be executed: wherefore for an example to all others who for the deſire of this worldly gaine, are content to betray the innocent, hee was ledde to the market place, and had his head ſmitten of. Now will we returne to ſpeak of the Quéene and her young ſonne, whom wee left in the Forreſt, beeing accompanied with brute beaſts.</p>

Thus continued ſhée by the ſpace of one whole yéere, neuer ſéeing other company then the wilde beaſts: although there were diuers ſearches made through the Forreſt, as well by the Knights that weſt in the queſt of her and the King, as alſo by others for diuers occaſions. It hapned one day that the Lion hauing brought in a young Kidde, which hée had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Quéene went forth to breake ſome wood to roſt the ſame withall: and taking her young ſonne with her, who by this time was able a little to goe and craule, and ſetting him downe in the ſunne whilſt ſhe went vp and downe, to breake rotten bowes and ſticks for the vſe aforeſaid, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her childe would continue quiet enough, playing with ſuch toyes as ſhe had left him, went ſomewhat farre from the place. Hée in the meane time, either béeing wearie of his ſport, or diſliking the place where he was, or more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſpeciall will of God, who pittying his and others miſhaps, had otherwiſe determined of his bringing vp, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to goe from place to place: ſo that by the time his Mother had prouided her wood, and was come to the place ſhée left him in, he was gone aſtray cleane out of hearing. Which when ſhe beheld, and had awhile called and ſought after him, not knowing what was become of him, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand imaginations came into her mind: ſometimes think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome wilde beaſts had deuoured him, then imagining againe, that the Lyon ſéeing him in that place by himſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:18"/> had carried him to the Caue, as oftentimes hee would be playing with him, and beare him from place to place: and béeing a little comforted with this hope, ſhee haſted her to the Caue, where likewiſe ſhee was deceiued of her hope, which put her into ſuch griefe, that not béeing able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine herſelfe on her féete, ſhée fell into a traunce. Where wee will leaue her awhile, and declare what became of the child. You ſhall vnderſtand, that the very ſame day, <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> paſſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Seas from <hi>England</hi> towards his owne Country, was driuen by force of weather vppon this Coaſt, where béeing ſafely arriued, with a few ſhyps of his Nauie, the reſt béeing diſperſt with the ſtorme, and béeing weary of the Sea, determined with ſome twentie or thirtie Knights, and Gentlemen in his companie, to take ſome recreation and paſtime in the Forreſt, which was hard adioyning vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea-ſide where his ſhips then rode, as is declared in the firſt chapter of this Booke. So taking their horſes and Armour, for feare of any danger which might happen, they altogether ſet foorth into the Forreſt, whereas they had not long rode, before ſuch time as a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous great Stagge appeared vnto them, which when Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> beheld, with his Launce in his hand, hee ſet ſpurres to his horſe, willing the reſt of his company to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, hoping by the ſwiftnes of his horſe to haue ſlaine the Stagge: which hee purſued ſo farre, that at length hee had loſt the ſight of all his company, and was entred ſo far in the Forreſt, that hée knew not well which way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, ſo thicke were the trées and buſhes, and ſo many the ſmall trodden paths which ledde two and fro, made by the wilde beaſts.</p>
               <p>Thus roming to and fro, fearing to looſe himſelfe, and hoping to finde his companie, at length hee paſſed by the place, where as the young child had gotten himſelfe by his crauling, whilſt his Mother was gathering ſticks (euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time that ſhe good Lady was returned to the Caue to ſeeke for him) which when Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> beheld, hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted downe from his horſe, and ſéeing it to be ſo fayre
<pb facs="tcp:150602:18"/> and no bodie nere it, hee muſed from whence it ſhould come, or by what meanes it might be brought into a place, ſo deſert and voyd of humane companie: then taking the childe vp in his armes, and earneſtly beholding it, hee thought that it did very much reſemble his young ſonne lago, who was then about the age of <hi>18</hi> or <hi>20</hi> monthes old, wherefore after hee had a while called to ſée, whether any body would come to ſéeke for the child, and ſawe that none came, he mounted againe on horſe backe, taking the childe with him, determining to haue him nouriſhed &amp; brought vp with his ſonne, becauſe they did ſo much reſemble and were ſo néere of age, imagining that it might bee ſome Gentlemans, or Nobles mans childe, that by ſome great miſfortune was brought into this extremitie, thus ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times muſing of one matter, and ſo of another, he rod on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he knew not well whether, but by chance he hapned on a ſmall beaten way, which brought him out of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, almoſt at the ſame place where he entred, where hée found all his companie in a great feare, and doubt what was become of him, minding to haue returned againe into the Forreſt to ſéeke for him. But when they ſawe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they were all filled with great ioy, &amp; went to méete him, to whom he recounted all his aduenture, and of the finding of the childe, which when they had heard, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, they much admired as well his ſtrange finding, as alſo the rareneſſe of his beautie, then which they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neuer to haue ſéene any more accompliſhed: ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining this, ſome that, and all they knew not what, this paſt they away the time vntill they were come, where their ſhippes ancored, and going aboord the next day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the wind faire, and the ſeas indifferently calme, they ſet ſaile in ſo happie a houre, that within foure daies after they arriued in the Dutchie of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> at a port called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> from whence they rode towards the Cittie of <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweke,</hi> where then the Dutches was remaining, of whom and the whole Cittie, the Duke was moſt louingly recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and welcomed home, who preſently after his comming
<pb facs="tcp:150602:19"/> to the Pallace, he demaunded for his young ſonne, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought before him, he cauſed likewiſe the childe which he found in the Forreſt to be brought alſo, who being both together, a man might very hardly knowe the one from the other, but that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince, was ſomething the bigger, as being elder by ſixe monthes, hand had alſo as then ſomewhat the better cullor, being noriſhed with more wholſomer diet. After they had a while beheld and played with the children, the Duke declared vnto the Dutches, and reſt of the Lords and Ladies there preſent, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his finding, as before is recited, and likewiſe willed to haue him brought vp, as acompanion with his ſonne, deſiring the Dutches to bee as carefull of him, as of her owne, aſſuring her that his minde gaue him, how that the childe was iſſued of a Noble bloode: &amp; becauſe they knewe not by what name to call him, the Duke willed him to bée called the Gentleman of the Forreſt, which name we muſt vſe vntill ſuch time, as fortune ſhall make knowne, from whence he is procéeded. Héere againe will wee leaue him, and returne to ſpeake of the Quéene his mother, whom we left in a traunce in the Caue, where hauing line a long while, and at length come vnto herſelfe againe, and remembring the loſſe of her childe, fell to wéeping, and renting, and tearing her face with her nailes, pulling her haire from her head, and curſing herſelfe which had taken no better care of him: then comming foorth of the Caue, ſhe went crying vp and downe, cauſing the woods to reſound the eccho of her ſon, ſéeking whether ſhee could in any place perceaue, either by bloud or other ſigne, if he were deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the wild beaſts, and finding none, ſhe fell againe to ſéeke in euery buſh, if happily hee might be crept therein, but all in vaine beſtowed ſhe her paines good Lady, to ſéeke for him which in that place could not bee found, for God had otherwiſe ordained, for the bringing vp of the child, as you haue already heard, though vnknowne to the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die his mother, who was now in ſuch extreame griefe, not finding nor knowing what was become of her childe, that
<pb facs="tcp:150602:19"/> ſhe became as franticke, wéeping, &amp; crying, vp and downe the Forreſt all that day, and moſt part of the night, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced with wearineſſe ſhe ſat downe, and reſted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Where ſitting a while, and contemplating her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, one whiles there would come into her minde, the remembrance of her huſband, and her former eſtate, being in ioy and proſperitie, the calling to minde whereof, did ſtrike into her the greater ſorrowe: for being in miſerie, there is no greater griefe, then to call to minde forepaſſed pleaſures: then againe, would come into her minde her viſion, which ſhe ſawe in the Forreſt, and the hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ioyes, which thereby was promiſed, which did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againe mittigate her ſorrowe, thus paſſed ſhee away all that night, in weeping and lamentations, neither caring nor thinking what might become of her, ſo exceſſiue was her griefe.</p>

               <p>Thus at length ſomewhat comforted with the hope ſhee had, that the prouidence of the moſt Higheſt, might turne

So hapning on a by path, onwards ſhe went ſo farre, that by the time that <hi>Phoebus</hi> golden Chariot was aſcended into the midle hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, ſhee found herſelfe euen at the place, where firſt in company of the King, and theyr traine of Lords &amp; Ladies, ſhée entred the wood, at ſuch time as they were ſet on by the Out-lawes.

At length, méeting with the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> and the reſt of the company, who were in all to the number of twelue Knights, beſides their Squires, and thinking by the coſtly Armor which he ware, him to be the chiefeſt in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, alighted from his horſe, and falling on his knées, with the teares ſtanding in his eyes, ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>Moſt curteous Knight, for ſo much my minde aſſureth you to be, I humbly beſéech you, and the reſt of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany heere preſent, for the honour of knight-hood, and the loue that you ought to beare to all diſtreſſed Ladies and Damſels, that you wil doe ſo much as ſuccour and reuenge a moſt beautifull Lady, who euen now in this Forreſt bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trauailing to a brothers houſe of hers, ſome 3. leagues diſtance from her owne, béeing accompanied with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, my Lord and Maiſter, and ſome foure or fiue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants more, whom I feare mee by this time are all neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſlaine, or grieuouſly wounded, by a ranck Traytor, who hauing long time ſued vnto my Lady for laſciuious loue, and not béeing able to maintaine the ſame, by reaſon of her chaſt and honeſt denials: this morning, knowing
<pb facs="tcp:150602:21"/> that ſhe was to paſſe this way, accompanied himſelfe with ſome tenne or twelue, as wickedly diſpoſed as himſelfe, whom hee had made acquainted with his villainous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, vnawares ſet vppon vs, &amp; at the firſt incounter grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wounded my Lord, by reaſon he was vnarmed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing but his ſword to defend himſelfe, as not dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any ſuch euill.</p>
               <p>Thus concluding his tale with whole floods of teares, which iſſued from his ſorrowfull eyes, which mooued pitty in all the beholders, eſpecially in the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> who not long before had taſted the like miſhap: willing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſquire to ſtand vp, and comfort himſelfe, aſſuring him, that he had met with thoſe, who would reuenge the wrong which hee had declared vnto them. Wherefore willing him to ſhewe which way he ſhould take, he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, and galloped as faſt as hee could, hoping to come ſoone enough to their ſuccour: which when the reſt of his companie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, they followed after as faſt as they could, but had not rodden long before they had loſt ſight of him, by reaſon of the thickneſſe of the wood, and the ſwiftnes of his horſe, which was accounted to be the beſt in all the Kingdome. Thus galloping onwards, at length he came where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way deuided it ſelfe into thrée ſeuerall paths, and taking that on the right hand, as thinking it to be the right way, hee rode on ſtill, neuer looking backe for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, ſo earneſt was his mind, ſet on the reſcue of the Lady and her huſband. The reſt comming after, when they came vnto the place where the way deuided it ſelfe, knew not well what to doe, nor which way to take, yet at length, béeing directed by the Squire, the moſt of them, as Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> tooke that way which ledde directly foorth betwéen the other two, appointing ſome to take the other wayes to follow the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> if peraduenture he had miſſed in his way.

The peaſant made aunſwere he ſaw no ſuch, but ſome halfe a mile before, he met foure Knights croſſing the way towards a little Caſtle, ſome two leagues of, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a very faire Lady pittifully wéeping, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought they conſtrained to goe onwards againſt her will. When <hi>Gwaltero</hi> had heard this, he aſſured himſelfe that this was the ſame Lady whom he went to reſcue, wherefore deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which way they went, the peaſant ſhewed him where they were riding vp a little hill, almoſt a mile before him, which when he beheld, he ſpurred on faſter then before hée had doone, ſo that before they were attained vnto the ſight of theyr Caſtle, he had ouertaken them in a fayre meddow, betwéene two ſmall hills. And calling to them, ſayd, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors turne, and deliuer me that Lady, whom ſo villainouſly you haue carried away, or your liues ſhall pay my ſworde her raunſome.</p>
               <p>They hearing him call, and looking backe, ſéeing but one Knight alone perſuing them, ſtayed, and he who ledde the Ladies horſe by the raines, being a very bigge and comly Knight, anſwered: fooliſh and moſt ſimple Knight, thinkeſt thou me ſo fond or faint harted, that only at thy threats, who art able to performe nothing but in words, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer this my prize whom I haue gotten ſo hardly, and with the price of much bloud, or that my loue towards her is ſo ſmall, ſo lightly to part from her. No, no, I counſell thée rather for thy owne ſafegard to depart away, or elſe this my Launce ſhall make your paſſe-port to old <hi>Caron. Gwaltero</hi> hearing this, and being no longer able to indure thoſe braues, placed his Launce in his reſt, and ſetting ſpurres to his horſe, they ranne together like lightning, and at the encounter their ſpeares ſlew into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire, <hi>Gwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:150602:23"/> many wounds, and was likely to haue béene ouercome, for by this time <hi>Brandoll</hi> had againe recouered his ſcences, and ſéeing the Knight who had brought him into that caſe, to continue ſtill fighting, againſt his Knights, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſlaine one of them, being vrged forwards, both with ſhame and griefe, taking his ſword in his hand, hée ranne vpon him like a fierce vnſkilfull maſtiue, who being once toſſed by the ſturdie bull, commeth on more haſtily then before: but <hi>Gwaltero</hi> perceauing him comming, ſéeming to méete him lightly, made a thruſt at one of the Knights horſes, which charged him on horſe-backe, which thruſt lighted ſo luckily, that ſo piercing his belly, hee cauſed him with his Maiſter to tumble to the ground, where by reaſon of one of his féete being in the ſtirrup, he could not ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly riſe againe, by which meanes <hi>Gwaltero</hi> the more naſier delt with <hi>Brandoll,</hi> and the other Knight, who ſéeing his fellowes miſchance, diſmounted himſelfe for feare of the like miſhap: now grew the foote combat more hote and fierce then that on horſe-backe, by reaſon that <hi>Gwaltero</hi> perceauing himſelfe almoſt wearied, and fearing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the other Knight, whoſe foote was in the ſtirrup vnder his horſe, layd on with al his might, but <hi>Brandoll</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrong Knight as moſt in that Country, ſéemed to ſet light by his furie, and charged him againe with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mighty blowes, as well hee gaue him to vnderſtand, that he knew better how to fight on foote, then on horſe-backe.</p>
               <p>The good Lady in the meane time ſate wéeping on her palfrie, being held by two of <hi>Brandolls</hi> Squiers, euer praying and beſeeching God, to preſerue and defend the ſtrange Knight, whoſe vertue and proweſſe ſhe much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and whom ſhe feared was not long able to indure the brunt of the battaile, for that the other Knight hauing recouered himſelfe from vnder his horſe, came likewiſe to to the combat, to her great griefe and ſorrowe.

Then Sir <hi>Cadrus</hi> cryed to the ſayd villaines, giue ouer fighting with that alone Knight, and defend your ſelues from the force of my Launce, and there with gaue one of them ſo ſound a buffet, that he had no néede at all to ſéeke for a Surgion, for his Launce entring in at his breſt, paſſed through his hart almoſt a yeard. Sir <hi>Brewes</hi> ranne at the other and miſſed courſe, but turning againe with his ſword in his hand, gaue him ſuch a blowe on the head, that cleauing his Helme, and wounding him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what déepe, cauſed him halfe aſtonied to fall to the ground. <hi>Gwaltero</hi> ſéeing this vnexpected ayde, béeing almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vtter diſpayre of victory, gaue <hi>Brandoll</hi> a ſore blow on the right legge, and cloſing with him, by cleane force o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew him to the ground, then ſetting his foote on his

And comming to the other whom Sir <hi>Brewes</hi> had wounded, would haue doone as much for him, but that hee immediatly fell on his knées, crying for mercy, proteſting for euer after to be at his commaund in all places whatſoeuer. <hi>Gwaltero</hi> vppon this his promiſe, granted him pardon, ſwearing him for euer after, not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wrong nor violence, to any Lady or Gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Then turning to Sir <hi>Brewes,</hi> and Sir <hi>Cadrus,</hi> hee gaue them hartie thanks for their ſuccour, without which he had béene doubtleſſe ſlaine. Demaunding of them likewiſe, what was become of the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> ſir <hi>Henault,</hi> and the reſt. And they told him how they parted at the 3. waies, to goe ſuccour the Lady whom hee had ſo well reſcued, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him likewiſe, that they did admire how or by what meanes the Lady was brought thether, ſeeing it was in the other way that ledde directly forward that they ſet on her and her huſband, as the Squire informed them.</p>
               <p>By this time the Lady being let goe by the two Squiers that held her, (who ſéeing their Maiſter ſlaine, made haſt by flight to ſaue their owne liues, which they might eaſily doe, for that no man purſued them,) came vnto the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> and falling on her knées before him, gaue him moſt humble thankes, as well for the ſafegard of her owne honor, which ſhée eſtéemed farre afore life, as alſo for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging her huſbands death: whom <hi>Brandoll</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fight had ſlaine, with ſome two or thrée of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, who put themſelues in their defence, with all, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him many large proffers for reward. But <hi>Gwaltero</hi> taking her by the hand, raiſed her from the ground, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her to be of good comfort, aſſuring her whatſoeuer hée had doone for her, was but his, and the dutie of euery good Knight, and therefore willed her to attribute it, not to him but to God, who is the reuenger of all wrongs: and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him but as an inſtrument, appointed by God to miniſter iuſtice on thoſe murderers. Then the Ladie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him and the reſt, to conduct her vnto a Caſtle of
<pb facs="tcp:150602:24"/> hers, ſome two leagues of, where ſhe would intreate them to reſt themſelues, vntill ſuch time as his woundes were throughly cured, which ſhould be doone by a damſell of hers, very expert in the Art of Surgery. Vnto which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, they eaſily conſented, eſpecially the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> whoſe hart was already wounded with the Ladies beutie. Then binding vp his wounds as well as they could, they mounted on horſebacke, directing their courſe towards the foreſaid Caſtle, &amp; the better to paſſe away the time, <hi>Gwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi> beganne to queſtion with the Lady of many matters, eſpecially of the cauſe of the late combat, which ſhee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, with ſuch a modeſt and comlie grace, that hée béeing before a little wounded with <hi>Cupids</hi> ſhaft, was now ſo altogether ouercome with loue, that either he muſt néedes ſue for grace, or die by concealing his affection: ſo feruent was the flame, and ſo weake his reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>By this time were they paſſed moſt part of theyr way, and were come vnto the Caſtle, euen about the time, that the Sunne drawing into the Weſt, ſéemed to take leaue of the view of theſe hether Regions, where by the Lady they were moſt kindly receiued: and welcommed with ſuch chéere, as the ſuddennes of the time could affoord. After Supper, the Lorde <hi>Gwaltero</hi> béeing brought into a moſt goodly and fayre Chamber, had his wounds carefully loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto, and dreſſed.

               <p>Gracious Lady, I doe not knowe, nether can I imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how theſe my ſpeeches, which at this time I ſhall bée forced to vetter, may be by you accepted, yet truſting in the gentleneſſe of your kind nature, haue made choiſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to open my griefe vnto you, then by concealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or euer to languiſh in paine. Know then, that ſince the firſt time it was my hap (when I fought with <hi>Brandoll</hi> and his companie) for to ſee you, that then your rare and ſingular beauty, wounded me more farre deeper, then did either their ſwords or Launces, which ſince by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall courtiſies, and by your many exquiſite vertues, which I haue behold in you, are ſo much augmented and increaſed, that vnleſſe you of your excellent bounty, take pitty and compaſſion on me, and with ſpéede yeeld ſome reliefe, vnto this my oppreſſed paſſions, I knowe not what to expect ſaue death onely, which if you ſhould prooue pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſſe, it would be moſt welcome vnto me: wherefore let me intreate you, to conſider theſe my paſſions, and to eaſe them with pitty, and thereby ſhall you gaine vnto your
<pb facs="tcp:150602:25"/> ſelfe for euer, a true Knight, and a conſtant louer. Thus concluding his ſpeech with a moſt déepe ſigh, procéeding from the bottome of his hart, he remained ſilent, attending her anſwere, which ſhould be to him either as life or death, to which ſhe replied.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but muſe at this your diſcourſe, neither can I chuſe but ſmile, to ſée your honor ſo merrily diſpoſed, to ieſt at me in this kind of ſort, hoping that mirth is a ſigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> amendment of your wounds, which to me would bee moſt ioyfull, ſéeing that in my defence you receaued them. But if theſe your ſpéeches procéede from you in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, knowe then, that the beauty which you ſay hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed you, in my conceit is of no ſuch force, as to wound a man of your worth, neither is it likely that ſo ſudden a liking as you ſpeake of, ſhould bee able to work any ſuch effect, if my curteſies haue béene the cauſe, they were neuer more then you deſerued, and therefore to be eſtéemed by you as a debt due from mee to be payd: if my vertues which you ſpeake of, they alas are ſo fewe, and ſmall, that they are not to be accounted of, but yet ſuch I hope, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould giue you an occaſion, to ſéeke to others, then any ſhow to yeild vnto your lawleſſe loue: for know for a ſuerty y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Menea,</hi> for ſo was ſhe called, regardeth more her honor &amp; good name, then ſhe doth all the riches or wealth of this world, knowing the one to be but momentarie, the other perpetuall: wherefore I beſéech your honor to giue of theſe vaine ſutes. But if you ſéeke to inioy me as your wife, which I thinke you will take ſcorne of, I being but a poore Lady, and deſcended but of a meane Parentage, in reſpect of your Lordſhip, yet notwithſtanding conſider I beſéech you, the late death of my huſband, whom if I ſhould ſo ſoone forget, it would for euer be accounted a great ignomie, and ſhame vnto me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gwaltero</hi> gladded to the hart, with this heauenly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and beeing as one newly reuiued out of ſome dead traunce, tooke her in his armes and kiſſed her, proteſting that he would moſt willingly remaine ſo contented, vntill the fixed time were expired, and then God willing, he would returne and eſpouſe her: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time he intreated her, to accept of that his ſmall Ring, which ſhould be a cauſe for her to remember him by, which ſhe then moſt willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and in requitall thereof, gaue vnto him a Iewell of hers, which hee alwaies after either in Tilt or Turnie wore, being faſtned in the creſt of his Helme, and which at all times put him in minde of his Lady and Miſtris.

But ſhe good Lady, not being able to ſpeake for wéeping, held him about the necke, often kiſſing him, as one loth ſo ſoone to forgoe his companie, yet at the laſt, ſéeing no remedie, intreated him to remember her and his promiſe, vntill which time of his returne, ſhe would ſpend her daies in prayer, for his ſafe and proſperous ſucceſſe.

               <p>Thus hauing ſtayd there twelue or fourtéene daies, not learning any newes at all of their infortunate King, they tooke their way towards the royall Cittie of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King then kept his Court, with a great aſſemblie of Lords and Ladies, which were then drawne together to behold a great Turny, proclaimed by the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> by the Kings conſent, againſt all ſtrangers: the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which Turny grew by this meanes. The Duke béeing a luſtie young Knight, was inamoured on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings eldeſt daughter, a moſt beautifull and goodly Lady, who
<pb facs="tcp:150602:27"/> for her grace, vertues, and beautie, had not her equall in all the kingdome of Fraunce, beeing called <hi>Emilia,</hi> whoſe perfections had ſo intangled his hart, that hee could not by any meanes frée himſelfe from béeing thrall to her beautie: and thinking no meanes better to winne a fayre Lady, then by ſhewing himſelfe valiant, hee continually frequented Tylts and Turnyes, oftentimes carrying away the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt prizes of valour: which was a meanes not onely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great loue, and fauour of the King, but alſo drew to him ſome liking of his Lady and Miſtris, the Princes <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi> which ſhe ſometimes would make ſhewe of, by her kind countenaunce, and pleaſant ſpéeches to him: which curteſies put him in ſuch an excéeding hope, and pride with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that thinking himſelfe halfe ſure of her loue, and that béeing graſt with the ſame, no man was able to compare with him, neither in happines nor valour: one day percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the King to be walking alone, in a pleaſant &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Garden, adioyning to the Pallace, came vnto him, and falling into ſome conference with him, at laſt intreated his Maieſtie to grant him leaue to proclaime a Turny, which hee, and ſome certaine number of Knights of the Court, would defend againſt all commers, for the ſpace of 3 daies. And that after, by the ſpace of ſixe dayes more, hée himſelfe would kéepe the field, and defend againſt all commers, his Miſtreſſe the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> to excell all others in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>The King hearing his demaund, and conſidering the great danger which thereby might happen to him, diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from it, aſſuring him, that it would be impoſſible to continue againſt ſo many, as would hazard themſelues in that enterpriſe: and that although he by his valor might ouercome many hardie and gallant Knights, yet at length, béeing wearie, &amp; tyred with ouermuch labour, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture be vanquiſhed, by one inferior to thoſe whom before he had ſubdued, whereby hee ſhould loſe his former reputation, gotten with no ſmall perrill and danger. This and many other matters, did the King alleage vnto him,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:28"/> to cauſe him to giue ouer that enterpriſe. But hee béeing as is before ſaid, ſo puffed vp with a ſelfe conceit, &amp; aſſurance of Fortunes fauour, imagining that on whom <hi>Venus</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Mars</hi> would not ſéeme to frowne, continued ſtill verie importiue, till at length, the King béeing ouercome by his earneſtneſſe, granted to his ſute.

               <p>In the meane time, the Duke ordained a place for the Tylt-yard, which was hard adioyning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pallace, which he cauſed to be inuironed in with railes of great height, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting at each end a large gate or entrance, that tenne Knights on horſebacke might enter in front.

Dinner being ended, euery one went to arme themſelues for the Turnie: where the ſtrangers bare themſelues ſo valiently, that they wonne the honor from the Courtiers, which was ſuch an extreame griefe vnto the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi> that for that night hee would not come to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, vowing the next day to be reuenged, eſpecially on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince and his companie, who twiſe that day had beaten him from his horſe.

The next day the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounding, warned the Knights to prepare for the

Thus being both reſolued, they met together ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that the Duke was forced to forgoe his ſaddle, and meaſure his length on the graſſe, the Prince paſſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſorely ſhaken, hauing loſt both his ſtirrups: at length recouering himſelfe, entred the preaſe, where on all ſides he beate downe Knights, and vnbarred Helmes, making ſuch way where he went, that he might eaſily be followed of his companie, eſpecially the Prince <hi>Charles, Henry</hi> of <hi>Burbon,</hi> Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and others, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the young Prince, ouerthrew all they met, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the French to giue backe and retire, euery man thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe happieſt, when he was fartheſt of.</p>

The Duke of <hi>Aniow,</hi> with his Launce before he brake, ſtrake downe thrée Knights to the earth, at laſt, being incountred by the Lord <hi>Douglaſſe,</hi> was diſmounted and taken priſoner, in diſpight of all his company. The Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> being againe remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, went raging vp and downe ſéeking for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince, and comming to the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> gaue him ſuch a blow, that hee draue both horſe and man to the ground, which being ſéene by Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> like a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged rod to him, and gaue him ſuch a blow, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to bow his head to his breſt. But the Duke reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
<pb facs="tcp:150602:31"/> himſelfe, returned him the like payment. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued they two, laying the one on the other, like two Smithes, ſtriking with their ſleadges on an Anuill: till ſuch time as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince, with a mace of ſtéele in his hand returned, &amp; gaue the Duke ſo puiſſant a blow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that breaking his ſhield in péeces, ſo amaſed him, that his horſe carried him from place to place in a ſound, which being ſéene by the King, and thinking the Duke to be ſore hurt: imagined likewiſe that it was impoſſible for any man to indure thoſe mighty blowes, which he continually ſaw the Prince to giue, cauſed the Iudges to make an end of the battaile, which was preſently doone, euery one attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the chéefe honor to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince, eſpecially the King, cauſing foorthwith a Herault of Armes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him, the cheefeſt Knight in the aſembly: and being brought to the windowe where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King ſaie, by the Iudges of the field, had a Garland of flowers ſet vpon his head by the faire <hi>Emilia.</hi> Which as ſhe was doing, vnawares was ſomething touched with loue towards him, which being by her then ſuffred to kindle, afterwards grew into a great flame. Thus being crowned as King of all Knights, hée was conducted with great honor to the Pallace, the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> being mightily grieued with his diſgrace, as alſo fearing the diſlike of <hi>Emilia,</hi> retired to his Tent, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not to come foorth of the Liſtes, till ſuch time as hée had recouered ſome part of his loſt honor.</p>

               <p>The Duke beeing no longer able to harken to his ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, being his coriuall: anſwered, no doubt but thy folly, hath ouercome thy braines, &amp; rightly doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure on thy ſhield ſignifie thy madneſſe, which is the ſelfe ſame Kite there repreſented, which ſéeketh before the Eagle to obtaine the Doue: but thou ſhalt preſently féele, the reward of thy folly, if thou abide but the ſtroke of my Launce. Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about his horſe, not ſtaying for any farther reply, went to fetch his courſe, the other doing the like, and ſetting ſpurres to their horſes, placing their ſtaues in their reſts, they ran together furiouſly, &amp; like two fierce rammes ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for ſuperiority, leauing a great diſtance betwéene them, that with the more might, they may come together with their horned heads, ſo met theſe worthy Knights, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Launces to flie into the aire, being broken into a thouſand ſhéeuers, and méeting together with their bodies, cauſes their horſes to réele backwards, to the wounder of the beholders, but quickly recouering themſelues, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to aſſault the one the other: ſéeking by all meanes, either, how moſt to indanger his aduerſarie, and to ſaue himſelfe: at length the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince lifting vp his ſword aloft, ſtarke the Duke directly on the vpper part of his ſhield ſo ſtrong a blow, that cleauing it into two péeces, his ſword paſſed forwards wounding him in the left thygh, but that blow was not long vnreuenged, for lifting vp his ſword with both hands, &amp; raiſing himſelfe in his ſtirrups, gaue the Prince ſuch a blow on the head, that had he not taken it with his ſheild, that blow had ended the battaile: but neuertheleſſe, paſſing through both ſhield and Helme, he gaue him a ſmall hurt in the head, cauſing him halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied to réele from ſide to ſide, but before he could deliuer another blow, the Prince had recouered himſelfe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in more fiercely then before, ſtrooke at his head, but by reaſon of the ſtarting of his horſe, the blow lighted on his ſhoulder, breaking the buckles and reuits of his poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and ſliding downe, gaue his horſe ſuch a wound,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:34"/> that being no longer able to containe his Maiſters weight, fell to the ground, which the Duke perceauing, made the greater ſpéede to auoyd his Saddle, and cléering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, recouered vpon his féete: which the Prince ſéeing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted alſo, then taking their ſwords and ſhields in hand, they beganne a moſt cruell and dangerous foote combat, to the amazement of all the beholders, who neuer had ſéene the like: for being both inraged with enuy and diſdaine, like Lions méete, or Bulls, or Tigers, fierce prickt on with hungers rage, finding a pray, or booty to their minds, fall out and ſtriue, and both with téeth, horne, and nayles, wound one the other, renting their entrailes, and dying themſelues, and graſſe with bloud, ſo ſtroue theſe two, and with their continued equall fight, their ſtéely Armor being not able to hold out the blowes, nor defend the thruſts, wherewith the one ſtill wounded the other, no man being able to iudge, to which ſide the victorie would incline, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one meruailing who the ſtrange Knight ſhould bee: at laſt the Duke beganne ſomewhat to ſhrinke backe, and to bare the remnant of his ſhield very low, which the Prince perceauing, ſéemed to increaſe his ſtrength, and followed him more fiercely then before, driuing him from place to place, till at laſt comming before the window where <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> ſtoode, the Prince caſting vp his ſight towards her, imediatly ſtood as one in a traunce, which the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing, beganne againe to gather courage, and gaue him two or thrée mighty blowes, telling him that hee would bring him out of his dumpes. Tis true replied the Prince, being halfe aſhamed at his folly, but to your paine. Then plucking vp himſelfe, they renewed their battaile, which ſéemed like to the burning of ſome hidden flaxe: hauing a while eſcapt the extremitie of the fire, which had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed great woods &amp; trées, and ſéeming to be extinguiſht, preſently renewes a flame againe, and ſo goes out. Such was their latter ſtrife, for the Prince being rowſed from his ſlumber, perſued him with ſo many waighty blowes, that the Duke being no longer able to hold out, fell to the
<pb facs="tcp:150602:34"/> ground in a traunce: which the Iudges perceiuing, came ſpéedily vnto them, fearing leaſt the ſtrange Knight would haue proffered him farther violence, but he, putting vp his ſword, demaunded whether there was ought elſe to bee doone. The County <hi>Palatine</hi> aunſwered, nothing but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the place as the Duke had before. Then the Duke was conuaied away, and being vnarmed, was dreſſed by the Surgians, which found no dangerous wound, but that his great loſſe of bloud, cauſed him to bee extreame weake and faintie. The Duke beeing couayed away, the King was very deſirous to know who the ſtrange Knight ſhould bee, and being about to ſend one vnto him, to that end. The Prince preſented himſelfe before him, and pulling of his Helme, deſired his Maieſtie to grant him leaue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Dukes challendge: when the King beheld him, and ſaw that it was the Prince, who had ſubdued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke, his griefe for his hurts, and ouerthrow was ſomewhat eaſed. Then ſpeaking to the Prince, hee ſayd, my Lord I did not thinke you would haue thus delt with vs, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, thus to haue put vs into ſuch griefe, as you haue doone by the wounding, and vanquiſhing of the Duke our Coſin: yet ſeeing it was his owne folly in making the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge, it doth the leſſe grieue vs. But for your requeſt in continuance thereof: I would wiſh you rather, to giue it ouer then to indanger your ſelfe therein, but if ſo be you are ſo minded, we fréely grant you leaue, praying to God ſend you better hap, then the Duke hath had before you. The Prince humbly thanked his Maieſtie: and then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> intreated her likewiſe to graunt him leaue, as her father had doone to defend her beautie, ſéeing that it was his hap to obtaine the ſame by his good Fortune. The Princeſſe being before hand a little touched with his loue, and now ſéeing the paines and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which he vndertooke for her ſake, was altogether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome: wherefore dying her chéekes with a maidenly bluſh, ſhe told him the paines which he already tooke, and that he would againe indure for her ſake, was vnknowne vnto
<pb facs="tcp:150602:35"/> her: yet becauſe ſhe would not prooue diſcurtious, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, ſéeing the King her father had thereto conſented, ſhe was content to accept him for her Knight, and to alow of that which he requeſted. The Prince héerewith beeing meruailous contented, returned her harty thankes, and ſo departed againe to the Tent, where hee was met by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prince, the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> and many others: and was by them diſarmed, and after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his wounds being bound vp, hee armed himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in a moſt coſtly Armor, ſet all with true loue knots, wrought of pure gold, and beeing attended by the foreſayd Lords, he entred the Liſts: where hee had not long remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before ſuch time, that there came a Knight of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples:</hi> a man in thoſe parts famouſed for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and hardineſſe, and being inamored on a young Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of that Country, promiſed her to come into <hi>France,</hi> whereby his valor, hee would cauſe her to bee for euer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſed: but his hap was ſo hard that at the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was ſent to meaſure his length in the ground, not being able to combat. After him that day, and the next day, he vnhorſed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of 40 Knights: the laſt day there came very fewe to try themſelues, the moſt part hauing in the fiue former daies, béene by the Duke foyled, by meanes whereof he paſt away the time in companie of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prince, and other great Lords, vntill it was almoſt Sun ſet, at which time there entred an ill fauoured withered face fellow, ſomething heigher then thrée horſe loaues, by birth a pagan, but brought vp by the Quéene of <hi>Portugall,</hi> as her Dwarfe, this proper aploſquire falling in loue with a Damſell, almoſt as hanſome as himſelfe, being likewiſe attending on the Queene, and hauing obtained her good liking on that condition, that he ſhould in all places main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her beauty: deſired the Quéene that hee might be made Knight, aſſuring her that he would ſo behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that thee and all others ſhould thinke the order well beſtowed vpon him. The Quéene ſéeing his earneſtneſſe yéelded vnto him, and cauſed him to be Knighted, who no
<pb facs="tcp:150602:35"/> ſooner hauing receaued the order, and hearing of the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> challendge, but he determined to fight againſt him, and cauſe him to confeſſe his peate, to more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then <hi>Emilia.</hi> Continuing in this imagination, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Picture to be drawne, and therewith came vnto <hi>Parris,</hi> entring the Liſts at ſuch time, as the Prince with the other Lords were ready to depart, and comming vnto the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prince, demaunded which was he that had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the Duke. The Prince meruailing to ſée ſuch a gallant in that equipage, demaunded what he would with him, marry quoth the Dwarfe fight with him, and cauſe him to confeſſe, that the Damſell which I loue, doth excell in beauty all others: the Prince ſmilling, hauing much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to containe himſelfe from laughter, demaunded who was his Lady, and where her Picture was. Hee aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe was attending on the Quéene of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and therewith drew foorth her Picture, at ſight whereof euery one burſt foorth in a great laughter. The Dwarfe being héerewith angry, aſked the Prince whether it were he or no that he had inquired for, the Prince aunſwered no, but ſhowed him the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince, withall telling him that the time was paſt, whereby hée had loſt his labor, vnleſſe hée could intreate him to Iuſt willingly.</p>
               <p>Then the Dwarfe comming vnto him, intreated him if the time were paſt, that yet in courtiſie he would breake a Launce with him: he ſmilling aunſwered, that betwéene that and Sunne ſet, hee was bound to Iuſt with any that ſhould come, wherefore he was contented. Then taking each of them a Launce, they ranne together: the Prince miſſing his courſe of purpoſe, but the Dwarfe with much adoe brake his Launce, almoſt diſmounting himſelfe with his owne ſtroke. The King, &amp; Quéene, withall the Lords and Ladies, laughed hartily héereat: the Dutches of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> telling <hi>Emilia,</hi> that now her Knight was like to looſe all his former honor.</p>
               <p>The Dwarfe had no ſooner broken his Launce, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he drew forth his ſwoord, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince intreated him,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:36"/> to runne one courſe more, which he eaſily yéelded vnto, then taking a new ſpeare, they ranne againe: the Prince taking him in the midſt of his Shield, bare him out of his ſaddle a whole ſpeares length, not béeing able to riſe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. Then was ſent vnto him by the King, the young Prince <hi>Phillip</hi> his ſonne, to intreate him to come to the Pallace, whether he went, béeing accompanied with diuers great Lords and Knights, and was very roially receiued by the King, the Quéene, and their fayre daughter, and feaſted with many ſumptuous and rare ſorts of viands, after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they fell againe to theyr wonted ſports of dauncing and maſking: where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince againe made his loue knowne vnto <hi>Emilia,</hi> aſſuring her, that vnleſſe ſhée pittied his eſtate, he was but dead, for without her, he was but as a ſhadow without ſubſtance, or as a body without a ſoule. The Princeſſe, who by this time was as much ſcorched with the flame as hee, and did féele as great force of loue, knew not well what to aunſwere, but at laſt yéelding to loue, ſhe told him, that if he loued her as hee made ſhew of, ſhée had no reaſon but to requite him with the like, but as yet ſhée was young, and at her Parents diſpoſition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe conſent ſhe could not make her owne choyſe, but if he could obtaine her Fathers conſent, ſhee was likewiſe contented to accept of him as her Lord and huſband.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV remember how the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> bringing with him the young Prince of <hi>Denmarke</hi> into his Dutchie, cauſed him to be brought vp with his own ſonne, calling him by the name of the Gentleman of the Forreſt, becauſe they knew no other name that he had. The Dutches, partly by the commandement of her huſband, &amp; partly for the beautie ſhee beheld in him, made great account of him, vſing to play and dandle with him, as much as with her owne ſonne: by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in ſhort time he beganne to recouer a freſh and liuely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſtill the elder they grew, the more like the children ſéemed the one to the other: and as in likenes, ſo alſo grew they in loue one to the other, delighting alwaies to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And béeing but children, if any one had hapned to wrong either of them, the other would alwaies helpe to be reuenged, which bred in the Duke and Dutches, ſo great content as might be. But comming to the age of 7. yéeres, they were inſtructed in the Latine and Gréeke tongues, by a Tutor who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Duke had appointed them for their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp. Hée béeing a very wife and diſcréet Knight, who in former time had ſpent his youthfull dayes in traueling ſtrange Countries, and ſeeking after aduentures, as was the vſage of Knights arrant: hee hauing as before is ſaid, the charge of education of the two Princes committed vnto him, inſtructed them ſo well, that in ſhort time they profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very much in thoſe languages, eſpecially the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Forreſt, as béeing of a more quick and readie wit, but otherwiſe, theyr diſpoſitions, &amp; conſtitutions both of mind and body were ſo like, that the Duke was forced to ſet marks whereby to know them: and theyr loue in like
<pb facs="tcp:150602:37"/> manner was ſo great, that had the one béene ſicke or ill at eaſe, the other ſéemed to be a partner in his griefe: if the one laughed, the other was ioyfull, if the one wept, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt néedes mourne to bare him company, ſuch a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of loue had Nature infuſed in them, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible for the one to liue without the others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>And comming to the age of twelue yéeres, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by theyr Tutor, to ride and manage horſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſo much profited, that in ſhort time they wexed very ſkilfull, eſpecially the Gentleman of the Forreſt, who both in aptnes of mind, and agilitie of body, paſſed the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of his time: which cauſed the Duke ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more to loue and eſtéeme of him, hoping that in time, God would manifeſt from whence, and of what parentage he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, imagining as well by his beauty, as alſo by his rare forwardnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he muſt néedes be iſſued of noble blood. The Dutches likewiſe grew into ſo great a liking of him, for his diuers rare and ſinguler vertues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe many times deuiſed with herſelfe, how and by what meanes ſhe might cauſe him to loue her daughter, whom hee eſtéemed as his Siſter, a Lady for beauty excellent, and for the perfections of the mind, able to compare with any then liuing. Shée I ſay, béeing of this mind, oftentimes reſolued to motion the matter vnto him, and to diſcouer vnto him the manner of his finding, which vnto him was vnknowne, by reaſon he was alwaies held and accounted as their naturall Childe: yet thinking that courſe might be a meanes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould come to age, for to forſake their Court, to ſéeke for his true Parents, ſhee gaue ouer that determination, minding to conferre with the Duke her huſband thereof. And finding him one night very merry, and pleaſantly diſcourſing, and commending of both the young Princes vnto her, ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto him her mind, and affirmed, that in her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there could be no better match for her daughter, ſéeing his vertuous behauiour, which was more to be eſtéemed then my riches whatſoeuer. The Duke did not greatlie

               <p>This Duke had within his territories, a moſt gracious and vertuous Ladie, beeing ſole heyre vnto her father, who was a man of large poſſeſſions, and greatly beloued in his Country, for his vertuous and vpright dealings to euery man. This noble Gentleman dying, and leauing his daughter about the age of 15 or 16 yeares, was ſought vnto of many great and mighty Lords: ſome for her lands and liuings, others for her beauty and vertues, and diuers for both. But to make ſhort this diſcourſe, ſhee was at laſt wooed, and wonne by a Knight of that Country, called <hi>Hoſtinius:</hi> a man who for his vertues and vallor in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry, might be thought equal with any Knight, in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and being married vnto the young Lady <hi>Vitella,</hi> they ſo well loued and liked together, that they ſcarce one euer gaue cauſe of diſlike to the other, which cauſed them to bée commended, and praiſed through all the Dukedome, and the confines there abouts: but this ioy and content, had not continued fully the ſpace of thrée yeares, before that froward Fortune enuying their bleſſed ſtate, cauſed her fame to be reſounded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares of the Duke <hi>Otho.</hi> Whoſe luſtfull hart beeing ſet on fire with report of her beauty, cauſed both her and her huſband to be ſent for to his Court, where beeing arriued, hee at the firſt moſt kindly receaued them, and as the old prouerbe is, made much of the childe for the Nurſſes ſake: ſo hee intertained <hi>Hoſtinius,</hi> vſing him with all the familiarity that might bee for his wifes ſake, alwaies ſéeking opportunity, to make knowne his luſtfull loue vnto <hi>Vitilla.</hi> And one day finding her ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at a window, looking into the Pallace garden: hée came vnto her, and after a little idle prattle, fetching a déepe fained ſigh, he declared vnto her his loue, vowing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, vnleſſe ſhe tooke pitty on him, and yeeld to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:38"/> there was no way but death with him, aleaging that as her beauty had wounded him, ſo was it her part to reléeue and comfort him againe, declaring that as by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhe was faire, ſo likewiſe ought ſhe to bee kind &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.</p>
               <p>The good Lady béeing halfe in a maze with this vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for proces, and ſcarce knowing how to aunſwer him, conſidering his nature to be ſuch, that an abſolute deniall might cauſe him to grow into choller, both with her and her huſband, and therby to worke both theyr confuſions. And likewiſe to féede him on with fained ſpéeches of loue, might bring her name in queſtion of ſlaunder, &amp; though for a time by that meanes ſhe might put him off, yet in the end, ſéeing himſelfe deluded, he would reuenge himſelfe with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crueltie, determined therefore of two euils to chuſe the leaſt: wherefore ſhe replyed in this manner.</p>
               <p>My gracious Lorde, I doe not thinke that you will ſo much diſhonour your ſelfe, as by forcing of mee to violate the holy rites of marriage, and to wrong my Lord and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in that ſort, as by your ſpéeches you pretend, which if you goe about to performe, know for certainty, that God who created all things of nought, will ſeuerely puniſh and reuenge ſo great a crime: and likewiſe aſſure your ſelfe my Lord, that whilſt I haue power and ſtrength to reſiſt, you ſhall neuer obtaine the ſame, wherefore I would wiſh your honor to giue ouer all ſuch wicked imaginations. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe flung away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in a great chafe, leauing him muſing on her ſhort aunſwer, and deuiſing which way hée might bring his will to paſſe, at laſt reſolued with himſelfe, that there was no way to accompliſh the ſame, but onely by the death of her huſband, hoping that hee béeing dead, ſhée might be brought to any thing. And béeing thus reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he went downe into the great Hall, where finding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of <hi>Hoſtinius</hi> ſeruaunts, hée made choice of one, whom he ſaw continually moſt néere vnto him: and taking him a ſide, declared vnto him his intent, and at laſt, with large promiſes wonne him, both to conſent, and alſo to be the

Her damſels which attended her, hearing the ſhréeke, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhée was not well, entred the Chamber, where they found their Lord dead, and theyr Lady in little better caſe, but at length, hauing recouered life in her, they called in the Gentlemen his attendants, who béeing entred, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deſcribe the ſorrow and lamentation which was made, where <hi>Eſtonio,</hi> in outward ſhewe, ſéemed not to be leaſt ſorrowfull, ſo well knew he how to diſſemble the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At laſt, the rumor heereof came to the eares of Duke <hi>Otho,</hi> who preſently like a man inraged with griefe, hee came poſting to the Chamber, where at his firſt entrance, to make ſhew of the loue which hee bare to the dead bodie béeing liuing, hée rent his hayre, beating his breaſt, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that he would haue giuen halfe his dukedome, to haue him aliue againe, although (GOD knowes) he himſelfe was the onely cauſe of his death. The good Lady, ſhee in the meane time ſwounded, and reſwounded, and had it not béene for the damſels, without all doubt ſhee would haue
<pb facs="tcp:150602:39"/> borne her huſband company amongſt the dead, ſéeing ſhée was depriued of him amongſt the liuing: ſo extreame was the gréefe which ſhe felt, &amp; ſo great the loue which ſhee bare him.</p>
               <p>The Duke in the meane time, for the better obtayning of his purpoſe, cauſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead body to be imbaulmed, ſaying he would haue him buried with the greateſt ſolemnity that might be, as the man whom he moſt loued: and becauſe it was impoſſible to be performed ſo ſuddenly, he would haue him kéept vnburied, by the ſpace of a month, againſt which time he warned all the chéefe of his Subiects to be there. Hoping in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time by one meanes or other, to worke <hi>Vitella</hi> to his will, wherefore euery day he would come to viſite her: many times declaring his paſſions vnto her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring her to conſent and yéeld thereto. But ſhe good Lady, not minding ſo ſoone to forget him whom ſhe loued ſo déere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither yet to make choiſe of one whom for his wicked life, ſhe could not chuſe but hate: and alſo, by his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſute, imagining that to gaine her, he might by ſome kinde of poyſon, haue made away her huſband, ſéeing that ſo ſuddenly he died: gaue him this aunſwere.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I know not the cauſe of this your importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſute, neither can I thinke but that it procéeds from a vild and ſinfull minde, that profeſſing ſo great loue as you did to my late Lord and huſband, you would tempt me his wofull wife ſo ſoone to forget him, and commit ſo vile an offence before God: wherfore know for a certainty, that I neither can, nor will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to loue him, whom my minde perſwads me to bee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtroyer of my late deceaſed Lord &amp; huſband: for without you had therein béene guiltfull, you would not haue perſiſted in this your wicked perſute after my honeſty.</p>
               <p>The Duke knowing himſelfe guilty, in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe had accuſed him, &amp; alſo growing into chollor with her rude deniall, briefly replied. Lady I perceaue that, that which cannot be obtained by faire meanes, muſt now at length be wonne by foule: and ſéeing that you wil not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb facs="tcp:150602:40"/> conſent vnto the thing, which in kind and milde ſort I haue intreated of you, know for a certainty, that I will winne it by force: &amp; whereas you accuſe me of murdering of thy vnfortunate huſband, aſſure thy ſelfe that the guilte thereof, ſhall lighten on thy owne head: which I my ſelfe will iuſtifie againſt thée. And thus ſaying, he departed her chamber, changing all his former loue into cruell hate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies pondring in his minde reuenge, till ſuch time, as his Nobles being come together, for the ſolemnizing of the funerals, at which time (comming as if hee would haue viewed the dead corpes) with ſome of his nobillity, laying his hand on his head, on a ſudden he ſéemed to féele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nayle: when fetching a déepe ſigh, hee cryed out, that his déere friend <hi>Hoſtinius,</hi> had béene ſlaine by treachery. The nobles beholding this ſudden accident, came and beheld the ſame, euery one imediatly iudging, that by that wound he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his death. The Duke aboue all others ſéemed moſt to wounder héereat, and at length turning to the company, ſayd, that he hoped to find out the murtherers, ſéeing God ſo ſtrangely had giuen knowledge of the déede, which vntill now was not ſo much as once dreampt of.</p>
               <p>Wherefore preſently cauſing <hi>Vitella,</hi> with all her Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells and attendants to be atached, he examined them eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, and comming to <hi>Eſtonio,</hi> whom hee before had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, examined him in ſuch ſort, that he declared how that the Lady <hi>Vitilla,</hi> had many times made proffer of her loue vnto him, and that he as often had denied her, becauſe he would not wronge his Lord and Maiſter: how that ſhe had proffered him, both to murder her huſband, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to marry with him, if he thereunto would giue his conſent: ſtill clearing himſelfe as much as it was poſſible. This confeſſion being vttered, ſhee poore diſtreſſed Lady was foorthwith condemned, not being ſuffered ſo much as once to ſpeake for her ſelfe, <hi>Eſtonio</hi> was likewiſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon: there for to remaine a while to bléere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes, who could hardly belieue that, which hee had iuſtified.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150602:40"/>
               <p>The ſame day the Duke procéeded in iudgement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Vitella,</hi> where he iudged her for her fault, to looſe all her lands, which he imediatly ſeaſed on, and that except within ſixe months, ſhe could find a Knight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her cauſe, againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke in ſingle combat: for he as a déere friend vnto her deaſed huſband, would be the man that would prooue that ſhe had comitted treaſon, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt him, with theſe conditions, that if he were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, that then ſhe ſhould be deliuered frée, and all her lands and goods reſtored vnto her, but if it hapne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he remained Victor, that both ſhee and the weake Knight, which ſhould put himſelfe in her defence, ſhould be burned a liue at one ſtake, which he cauſed for the ſame purpoſe to be ſet vp in the midſt of the Market place.</p>
               <p>This ſentence pronounced, ſhe good Lady was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder ſafe kéeping: no body but ſuch whom the Duke appointed, being ſuffered to come vnto her. Which cauſed many to iudge the Duke rather to be guilty then ſhe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch who had knowne the great loue betwéene her, and her deceaſed huſband: conſidering alſo, that onely by this meanes he had gotten her inhearitance into his hands, which was the chiefeſt marke he aimed at.</p>
               <p>Now to returne againe to our purpoſe, the Lord <hi>Gwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi> and his company, comming as before wee haue ſaid into <hi>Viena,</hi> hapned to take vp his lodging in a kinſmans houſe of the Lady <hi>Vitellas,</hi> who (by reaſon of her miſhap) was very ſad &amp; penſiue: and béeing ſitting at ſupper, was demaunded the cauſe of his ſorrow by the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> vnto whom hee declared the former diſcourſe, with the loue of the Duke vnto <hi>Vitella,</hi> which he had likewiſe learned of her, not forgetting in any one poynt, to declare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wickedneſſe of the Duke, therby the eaſier to perſwade his crime likewiſe in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gwaltero</hi> hauing attentiuely liſtned vnto this diſcourſe, meruailed greatly at the ſtrange tyranny of the Duke, and béeing halfe reſolued of the Ladies innocencie, determined with himſelfe, to put himſelfe in her defence, wherefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
<pb facs="tcp:150602:41"/> how hee might come to ſpeake with the Ladie, and alſo, how néere the time appointed for her execution was expired, (for that he was loth to tarry ouer-long in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place, becauſe of his returne vnto his Lady &amp; Miſtriſſe) his Hoſt replied, that the time of her death was now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſixe dayes, and that as yet ſhee was not prouided of any Champion, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke was a ſtrong puiſſant knight, and the condition of the combat ſuch, that euery one fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to entermedle therein: and as touching the meanes to ſpeake with her, if he would vouchſafe to take the paynes, he would (ſupper béeing ended) conduct him to the place, where hee ſhould from her owne mouth, heare what ſhee would ſay to cléere herſelfe. <hi>Gwaltero</hi> béeing by nature pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and alſo by oath of Knight-hood bound to helpe, and ſuccour thoſe that were diſtreſſed, conſented to goe with him to the priſon. Where béeing come, and brought into the preſence of <hi>Vitella,</hi> her Coſin declared the cauſe of their comming, who after thanks to them giuen, and lifting vp both her eyes and hands towards heauen, proteſting her innocencie, ſhe declared as much as ſhe knew touching the ſame, vtterly denying any loue towards <hi>Eſtinio,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaue onely her Lord <hi>Hoſtinius. Gwaltero</hi> being fully reſolued of her innocencie, demaunded if ſhe would put her caſe into his hands, who would for her deliuery aduenture his life, and no doubt but her cauſe béeing iuſt, God would proſper theyr quarrell. Shée humbly thanking him, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſéeing he ſo curteouſly offered himſelfe, to him and God onely ſhe committed her caſe: deſiring, that according to her innocencie he might ſpéed therein, and no otherwiſe. Then taking theyr leaue, till the day came he departed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her ſomewhat comforted with hope of her Knights good ſucceſſe, and equitie of her cauſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. How <hi>Gwaltero</hi> combatted with the Duke, and ſlew him, &amp; of the kind proffers that were made him by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itella</hi> &amp; the Nobility, with his departure thence.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE day béeing come, wherin the Lady <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella</hi> was either to bring foorth her Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or elſe to commit her body to the fire, the Duke béeing royallie accompaned, entred the Liſts, cauſing her in continent to be ſent for, and béeing come, demaunded for her Champion, ſhée aunſwered, that God had prouided her one, who at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſound of the trumpet would likewiſe appeare. The Duke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſhée was prouided of a Knight, wondred what he ſhould be, and béeing prickt in conſcience with the guilt of his fault, grew halfe into diſpaire, and would willinglie (if it might haue béen with his honour) haue deſiſted from the Combat. But God who hardned the hart of <hi>Pharao,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hardned his, thereby the more euidently to make knowne vnto the world, his mercy and louing kindnes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that feare him, and his iuſtice on them, which againſt their owne conſciences commit ſinne and iniquitie. So that cauſing firſt the Lady to be conuayed towards the ſtake, the trumpets were ſounded, but no Knight was ſéen to approch, which cauſed him to grow more proude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, thinking then, that no man dared to combat againſt him. But at the ſecond warning the Lord <hi>Gwaltero</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, mounted on a mighty Courſer, with his Launce on his thigh, and his Helmet on: in this ſort came hee before the Iudges, and lifting vp his beuer, made a little ſhew of reuerence, then procéeding on with his ſpéech, he ſaid, that béeing accepted of <hi>Vitella</hi> as her Knight, hee was come to defend her innocencie: and that he marueiled, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed Iudges of the fielde, would contrary to all reaſon, ſend her towards the place of execution, before the Combat were ended: then deſiring that ſhe might again be
<pb facs="tcp:150602:42"/> ſent for, he held his peace: which they foorthwith cauſed to be done, placing her whereas ſhe might behold the iſſue of the battell. In the meane time, the Duke comming vnto <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> demaunded what, and of whence hee was, who aunſwered, that he was a Knight arrant, of the kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and paſſing through his Country, had heard of his cruelty ſhewed vnto the diſtreſſed Lady, and béeing mooued with pitty, was come to vndertake her defence, which he hoped ſo well to performe, as before night to cauſe him confeſſe his treaſon againſt her. The Duke raging hereat, replied, that doubtleſſe he was ſome one of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that béeing weary of his life, was come for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be burnt with her, which ſhould be performed with all the torments that might be.</p>
               <p>Now by this time <hi>Vitella</hi> béeing brought backe and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the Iudges cauſed both Knights to be ſworne, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned by a Herault euery one to doe his beſt, they ſet ſpurres to theyr horſes, and incountred ſo rudely, that the Duke was throwne out of his ſaddle, béeing wounded a little vnder the right breaſt, and ſore bruſed with the fall, <hi>Gwaltero</hi> was not wounded at all, but yet by reaſon of the mightineſſe of the encounter, his horſebacke brake vnder him, wherefore he was in like ſort driuen to alight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both on foote, they began a cruell and fierce fight, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their ſhields, and hewing their armor in péeces, ſo that euery blow cauſed the blood to trickle downe, dying the gréne graſſe into a ſcarlet hue. Thus continued the fight a long time very vncertaine, no man knowing to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory would incline: ſome-whiles the one tryumphing in the others loſſe, and by and by againe, the other reioycing to ſée his enemy ſtoope. Thus continued they the ſpace of thrée houres, the beholders meruailing they could indure ſo long: at length ſtanding to breathe themſelues, the Duke ſpake vnto him, ſaying, Knight, thou ſéeſt that as yet I haue the aduantage, but the great vallour which I haue found in thée, makes me to pitty thy eſtate, wherefore I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to remit thée the Combat, conditionally that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilt
<pb facs="tcp:150602:42"/> remaine with mee, and alſo I will giue vnto thée halfe of her lands whom thou defendeſt. Nay, nay, replied <hi>Gwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero,</hi> I ſcorne thy proffers, but if thou wilt reſtore the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and her goods, and confeſſe héere before this company, thy treaſon committed againſt her, I will grant thee thy life: otherwiſe looke for no mercy at my hands. Then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theyr ſwords in their hands, and couering themſelues with the remnants of their ſhields, they fell againe to their former conflict, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued not long before that <hi>Gwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi> deliuered a mighty blowe on his head, which cleft his Helme in two, and wounded him ſo ſore that hee fell to the ground, which <hi>Gwaltero</hi> ſéeing, ſtept vnto him, and would haue ſlaine him out-right, had not he intreated mercy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to confeſſe the whole circumſtance of the treaſon.</p>
               <p>Then the Iudges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto him, hee confeſt firſt his loue to <hi>Vitella,</hi> then the murder of <hi>Hoſtinius,</hi> and laſtly his hate towards her for refuſing him, from whence grew this manner of reuenge which be intended.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he made his confeſſion, but turning about his face he immediatly dyed. Then the Iudges cauſed his body to be carried away, to the intent to haue him interred, but they were ſaued of that labour, for a flock of Wolues comming from out of the woods there adioyning, deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his accurſed carkaſſe, to the great admiration of all the beholders. Then immediatly was, <hi>Vitella</hi> brought downe, and greatly honored, and <hi>Eſtonio</hi> being apprehended, was burned in the fire prepared for his Lady. <hi>Gwaltero</hi> béeing conducted to his lodging by the Nobility and <hi>Vitella,</hi> was by them vnarmed, &amp; his wounds very carefully looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, where hee remained the ſpace of eyght wéekes, during which time hee had many great proſfers made him by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella,</hi> as the inioying both of herſelfe, &amp; all her inheritance, and by the Nobilitie hee was proffered to be accepted as theyr ſoueraigne Prince and Duke, if ſo be hee would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Vitella</hi> to be his wife. But hee who had ſetled his minde in another place, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all harty thanks for theyr good wills towards him, excuſing himſelfe as well as hee
<pb facs="tcp:150602:43"/> might, and deſiring them to beſtowe it on ſome one more worthy then himſelfe, with whom <hi>Vitella</hi> might be coupled in marriage. Thus excuſing himſelfe from receiuing that which moſt men would haue coueted, hee remained there till his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were throughly whole, then taking his leaue of <hi>Vitella</hi> and the reſt, he departed towards the confines of <hi>Belgica,</hi> hauing receiued of <hi>Vitella</hi> both horſe and Armor, for a remembrance of her, in ſteed of his owne, which in the battell againſt the Duke was broken and ſpoyled.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150602:43"/> fiue, ſo that it was impoſſible for one man to vanquiſh them all. But if it ſo hapned that the ſtraunge Knight, were by them ouercome, then to looſe both his horſe and Armor, and ſo to depart: vnleſſe it were ſuch a one whom they knew to be their enemy, and then was he ſure to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. This cuſtome he rayſed, becauſe thereby he hoped to impriſon as many of the <hi>Danske</hi> Knights, as ſhould paſſe that way in ſearch of their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gwaltero</hi> hearing of this cuſtome, and being deſirous to ſée the ſtrength and ſituation of the place (ſo much ſpoken of, together, imagining that peraduenture their King might be there impriſoned, as indéede he was) minded to goe ſée the ſame, and then if his minde ſerued him, to make triall of the aduenture. Thus being reſolued, he ſecretly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Gaunt,</hi> accompanied only with his Squire, leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him both Sir <hi>Brewes</hi> and <hi>Cadrus,</hi> not knowing what was become of him: in this ſort he ſhaped his courſe the next way thetherwards, where the tenth day after he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, about nine of the clocke in the morning: and comming to a ſhield that hunge on a Trée thereby, ſtrake the ſame ſo hard, that the whole Caſtle reſounded thereof. Then came foorth the firſt fiue Knights, one of them demaunding what he ſought: <hi>Gwaltero</hi> told him he would very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter the Caſtle, to behold whether it were ſo faire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as it ſhowed beautiful without. Yea replied the Knight, but firſt you muſt according to our cuſtome Iuſt with me, and my fellowes, whom except you ouercome, you are not like to gaine entrance: I haue heard (replied he) if I be not deceaued, your cuſtome, which maketh me ſomething the more deſirous to enter, in regard I thinke that a place ſo fenced &amp; defended without, cannot chuſe but haue things worth the beholding within: wherefore I am contented to make triall of my fortune, by the ſtrength of my arme. Then couching their Launces, they two ranne together ſo fiercely, that the Knight of the Caſtle was tumbled head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ouer his horſe taile, not being able to riſe againe, by reaſon of the weight of his Armor, which ſo ſore bruſed him
<pb facs="tcp:150602:44"/> in his fall. Then ranne another of the Knights, but for haſt miſſed his courſe: but <hi>Gwaltero</hi> beeing more circomſpect, in hauing a great deale of worke to doe, met him ſo rightly, that his Launce paſſed through his body aboue a yard, cauſing him to fall dead to the ground: then his Squire brought him the Launce of the dead Knight, with which he met the third ſo ſoundly, that he ſent both horſe and man to the ground, wherehence he was not able to ariſe in haſt, by reaſon that both his féete were ſo faſtned in his ſtirrups, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee could not cléere himſelfe, but lay ſtill vnder his horſe, which ſtriuing to get vp, had almoſt ſquiſed out his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters breath.

The fift had ſomewhat better lucke then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, for at the firſt courſe he was not not diſmounted, by reaſon <hi>Gwalteros</hi> horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied with his former trauell, euen as they came to meet, ſtumbled vnder him, whereby he miſt his courſe, the other breaking his ſpeare in the midſt of his ſhield, paſt on without doing any farther hurt: then taking a new Launce they ranne againe, where the ſecond time <hi>Gwalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> met him ſo directly, that caſting him out of his Saddle backwards, hee pitched on the ground with his head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, falling ſo heauie that hee brake his necke withall.

Now by this time were two of the other fiue on horſe-backe, prouiding themſelues for the Iuſt: and all the reſt of the Knights of the Caſtle, were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the battlements, to behold the iſſue of the battaile: arming themſelues likewiſe, who ſhould be the next fiue. Thus the two Knights being mounted and furniſhed at all points, cried vnto <hi>Gwaltero</hi> to defend himſelfe: then pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their Launces in their reſts, and ſetting ſpurres to
<pb facs="tcp:150602:44"/> their horſes, they ranne together with all their force, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their ſtaues in the midſt of his ſhield, with ſuch might, that they cauſed his horſe to ſtagger backwards, hauing much adoe to recouer himſelfe from falling, but he himſelfe ſéemed to moue no more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they had runne againſt ſome huge Oke, but his ſtroke was not to ſo ſmall purpoſe, for charging his Lance againſt him on his right ſide, gaue him ſuch a ſound blow, that piercing both his ſhield and armor, the ſpeares head entred cleane through his hart, cauſing him to fall as dead as a dogge to the ground. Then turning about (their courſe béeing ended) demaunded whether hée muſt iuſt with the other Knight againe, and they anſwered yes: then calling to his Squire to bring him another lance, they ranne againe, where the other Knight was forced to meaſure his length on the ground, bearing his ſaddle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene his legges.</p>
               <p>Then againe changing his horſe, hee prouided himſelfe againſt the other thrée, who béeing all mounted on verie good horſes, charged him at once, two of them breaking theyr ſtaues on his ſhield, and the other miſſing his courſe, was ſent headlong to the ground for beeing ouer haſtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gwaltero</hi> béeing ſore ſhaken with that incounter, could haue béene contented to haue giuen ouer running for that time, but yet béeing compelled to it by reaſon of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, tooke a freſh Launce in hand, and there-with met one of them ſo right, that for euer after he made him ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for running. The other perceiuing his fellowes to be ſlaine, and that no force was able to preuaile againſt him, determined at the next courſe to kill his horſe vnder him, hoping thereby to ſaue himſelfe from the ſtroke of his Launce: and béeing thus reſolued, ranne againe, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the poynt of his Launce full againſt <hi>Gwalteros</hi> horſe breſt, where entring, he ſlew the horſe, but eſcaped not him ſelfe ſo well as he hoped for, by reaſon that the horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo fiercely, gaue ſomething backe, but brought his Maiſter ſo néere him, that he ſtrooke him full in the fight of the Helme, and the barre béeing weake, gaue paſſage for
<pb facs="tcp:150602:45"/> the ſpeare to his braines, ſo that they fell to the ground both together. And <hi>Gwaltero</hi> cléering his féet out of the ſtirrups, lightly recouered himſelfe againe, and adreſſing his ſhielde on his arme, with his ſword in his hand, hee marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle gate, minding (ſéeing that he had procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo farre) either to enter, or die in the purſute. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was come fully to the entrance, the fiue Knights, who were appointed to combat firſt with him, came foorth, and all at once aſſaulted him: then beganne there a moſt fierce and bloody fight, very hard and vnequall, by reaſon they béeing fiue, and he but one, and alſo before ouerlabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his former trauell, was not able to doe as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would: yet notwithſtanding, he layd on ſuch cruel blowes, that euery one iudged himſelfe happieſt when as he was fartheſt from him, the lookers on admiring how it was poſſible for one alone Knight, to ſhewe ſuch proweſſe, as by defending himſelfe againſt ſo many, but at laſt being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied, &amp; wounded in many places, hauing loſt much of his blood, was forced through faintnes to fal to the ground, hauing before his fall ſlaine two of them out-right, and very ſorely wounded the others, then béeing no longer able to reſiſtance, he was carried priſoner into the Caſtle, where he had his wounds bound vp &amp; dreſſed, being pittied of many who had beheld his vallor, but béeing cured of his wounds, and examined of whence he was, hee was committed priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into the dungion where the wofull King lay, thereby thinking the more to grieue him. Who no ſooner was let in-the dungion, but they one knew the other, making the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt lamentation and ſorrow that might be, but at length comforting themſelues as well as they might, they made relation of their fortunes each to other, hoping that in time God would ſend them deliuerance from all theyr troubles.

               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, (al this and their ſolemne vowes, ratified vnder their hands and ſeales, for the continuance, and performance of that kind of ſtate, and gouernment) they were in a manner, the firſt that repined againſt it, ſéeking by all the meanes they could, to ouerthrow and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſame, either for the enuy they bare towardes thoſe who were Gouernors, or for that themſelues had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince the firſt yeare hapned to be of the twelue, or elſe (and that which I thinke to be moſt likelieſt) beeing ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the deuill, they deſired greater ſuperiority, then either became them, or by any waies they were worthy of, yet doubting to agrée within themſelues, being but thrée, hauing the gouernance in their owne hands, determined therefore to elect and chuſe a King: who beeing by them ſo raiſed, could not chuſe likewiſe but to be rulde by them, and that vnder the cullour of the King, they might reuenge themſelues of their enemies: and likewiſe preferre their
<pb facs="tcp:150602:46"/> friends to honor and dignitie. And hauing thus reſolued betwéene themſelues, they ſolicited the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Diadem, promiſing him by their letters, that if he would but ſend ouer tenne thouſand Souldiers, vnder the conduct of ſome expert Leader or Captaine, that then they would ſo ayde him, that in leſſe then a yeare, he ſhould haue all <hi>Denmarke</hi> in his ſubiection: conditionally, that they thrée might continually haue and inioy to themſelues, the chiefe offices belonging to that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King (harkning vnto this iolly proffer) at the firſt made ſmall account thereof: but afterwards way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelfe the great benefits and proffits, which thereby might riſe, not onely to him: but to all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Subiects, if he might ſo eaſily obtaine the ſame, as in their letters they made ſhowe of: and beeing againe by them ſolicited anew, writing vnto him in their letters, that vnleſſe he accepted thereof, they would giue it vnto the King of <hi>England,</hi> or ſome other Prince, whom they knew would more thankefully accept of their kind offer. The County <hi>Hermes</hi> in a priuate letter beſides, wrote how that if his Maieſtie would (hauing conquered the Kingdome) make him Viceroy or Deputy thereof, he would ſend ouer his eldeſt ſonne to remaine as pledge, vntill ſuch time as he had performed, whatſoeuer hee made promiſe of: and that then he would render him ſuch tribute, as by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſhould be thought fit. Now when he had himſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed theſe letters, (and caſt all doubts he could) he made them knowne to his priuy Counſell, who after long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, at length gaue him this anſwere, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the minde, his Maieſtie ſhould accept their proffer of the Kingdome a gift well worth the acceptance, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to graunt them their owne deſires, in that which they ſhould demaunde, till ſuch time as beeing Maiſter of the Country, hee might at his pleaſure, then alter any thing that he would. In the meane time, to receaue pledges of their meaning, leaſt otherwiſe he might repent too late. Thus hauing determined, the King ſent ouer ſecretly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was in the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a noble man called <hi>Segnior Adreſto,</hi> famous for his vertues and Chiualry: and hauing paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a great part of the world, in ſéeking and following of ſtrange aduentures, alwaies hauing fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſucceſſe in all his enterpriſes, eſpecially in his loue, which hee bare towards a noble Lady of his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, called <hi>Leonarda,</hi> daughter and ſole heyre vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Tolledo:</hi> one who for beauty and comlineſſe of body, was the only paragon of all <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſought vnto by many, but only inioyed by <hi>Adreſto,</hi> betwéene whom there grew ſo great loue, that whoſoeuer had ſéene or knowne the ſame,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:47"/> would haue ſworne, that then loue there had béene no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dietie. Which when the Duke her father vnderſtoode, being loth to match her vnto one of ſo meane eſtate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for his vertues he might compare with any, yet was his liuings very ſmall: therefore he often warned her to auoyd his company, and at length grew in great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her, threatning to diſinherit her, if ſhe did not obey vnto his will héerein. Which the young Lady doubting, at their next méeting, made him priuy withall, aſſuring him that for his loue ſhe could be contented to forſake all. But yet ſéeing that in time her fathers good will might bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſhe would intreate him for a while to abſence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: aſſuring him, that for her part, ſhe would alwaies continue faithfull and conſtant vnto him, and neuer accept of any other huſband, though thereby ſhe were diſinherited. <hi>Adreſto</hi> hearing her kind and louing ſpéeches, aunſwered, that ſéeing it was her pleaſure, he was contented, although to be out of her preſence would bee a hell vnto him: and whereas ſhée had made him ſo frée a graunt of her loue, he proteſted before the heauens likewiſe neuer to forſake her, and that before he would conſent to loue any other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he would be torne to péeces with wilde horſes: then deliuering each other aſigne of their paſſed faiths, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And within ſhort time after left the Kingdome, trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many ſtrange and vnknowne Regions, till at laſt comming into the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee hapned to fall in likingly with a beautifull Damſell of that Country, but of meane parentage: her father being but a Marchant of that Country. On whom he ſo doted, that he had cleane forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and forſaken the chaſt and vertuous Lady <hi>Lenarda:</hi> although the good Lady hauing intelligence héereof, by a friend of hers, a ſkilfull Magitian, oft times ſent vnto him, to cauſe him to call to minde his former loue. At length the Duke her father dying, and leauing her ſole Miſtirs and Dutches of his Dukedome, ſhee hauing with great pompe &amp; ſolemnitie celebrated his funerals, one day ſent for her friend the Magitian to come vnto hor, of whom ſhe demaunded if there were no meanes, to recall her louer
<pb facs="tcp:150602:47"/> 
                  <hi>Adreſto</hi> againe, without whom ſhe was like to ſpend her life time in care and heauineſſe. <hi>Adriano,</hi> (for ſo the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian was called) made her aunſwere, that he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly aunſwere her demaunde: becauſe that ſhe (whom he ſo loued) wore alwaies on her finger a Ring, which was the only ſtay of his loue, which except they could get from her, it was impoſſible, euer to remooue his affection. Alſo this Ring had one other vertue, which was that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did weare it, ſhould not looſe ſo much as a drop of blood in any battaile whatſoeuer: wherefore when he combatted with any one, (as oft times he did for her loue,) then had he the Ring. And vnleſſe there could be found a Knight, that might by force conquer him in ſingle battaile, and take away the Ring from him, it was impoſſible to get the ſame by any deceit whatſoeuer. <hi>Lenarda</hi> hearing this, was as one halfe beſides herſelfe, but being comforted by <hi>Adriano,</hi> (who aſſured her he would trie the vttermoſt of his ſkill to find out the Knight, as he had ſpoken of.) Then taking his leaue of her, he returned home: where by his art he framed a moſt rich and faire ſword, excellent curious to the eye, and to cut, the beſt that was then in the whole world: this ſword he inchaunted in ſuch ſort, that no man but hée to whom the conqueſt of <hi>Adreſto</hi> appertained, might drawe the ſame: then bringing it to <hi>Lenarda,</hi> willed her to ſend one of her Squires therwith, to ſéeke out the Knight who ſhould by his vallor recouer her loue: then deliuering it to one of her Squires, whom ſhe eſtéemed for his truth and ſecricie, with this commaunde, that whoſoeuer ſhould offer to draw foorth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword, ſhould firſt make promiſe of a boone, which was to goe ouer into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to combat with <hi>Adreſto,</hi> accuſing him for falcifying of his faith to <hi>Lenarda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Squire (hauing the ſword) trauelled to all the Princes Courts in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Countries thereabouts: then into <hi>Fraunce, Italie,</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> neuer finding any one that could once mooue it in the Scaberd: although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtout &amp; hardy Knights made triall thereof, to this great griefe, fearing his trauell ſhould neuer haue end, nor his Lady eaſe of her ſorrowe. In this manner hauing trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:150602:48"/> through moſt part of <hi>Germanie:</hi> he arriued at the Court of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> deſiring the Duke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his Knights might make triall, if it were any their fortunes to accompliſh that, for which hee had trauailed ſhe greateſt part of Chriſtendome. Then ſhewing his ſword, hee declared, that bearing the ſame a whole yeere, he could neuer finde any one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might draw the ſame. The Duke wondring héereat, immediatly after Dinner, cauſed all his Knights to make triall therof, himſelfe béeing the firſt, but al to no end applyed they their forces. Which when the young Prince <hi>Iago,</hi> and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Forreſt beheld, they preſently fell on theyr knées before the Duke, deſiring his grace to grant them the order of knight-hood, hoping that for one of them this Aduenture was reſerued.</p>
               <p>The Duke béeing vnwilling at the firſt, by reaſon of their young age, that béeing knighted, they would hazard themſelues in ſéeking after ſtrange aduentures, aduiſed them to ſtay a yéere or two more, before they tooke ſo wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a charge on them: affirming that it was vnlawfull to dubbe any one, before the age of twenty, at which time they would be ſtrong, and able to indure the weight of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and trauell, and not before. All which could not cauſe them to deſiſt from theyr ſute, but ſtill more earneſtlie they craued the ſame, alleaging many ſundry examples of thoſe who at younger yéeres had inured themſelues to as great labours, as <hi>Reynaldo</hi> at the age of fiftéene yéeres ſtealing from his fathers court, went into <hi>Paleſtina</hi> to the Chriſtian Armie, where vnder great <hi>Godfry</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> he obtained to be the chiefe ſcourge to the Saraſins, and without whom, it had béene impoſſible to haue wonne the holy Citty of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> This and many other ſuch like arguments they alleaged, wherby at length they obtained the Duke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto them: willing them for that night, according to the auncient cuſtome, to watch in the Chappell. Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Squire, hee intreated him to tarry till the next day, ſéeing the two young Gentlemen were ſo deſirous. The Squire, to ſatiſ-fie the Duke, willingly conſented, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:150602:48"/> he had no great hope of theyr ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>The two Princes carefull of their charge, hauing theyr Armor and other neceſſaries prouided, kept theyr deuout watch all night, ſometimes accompanied by the young Princeſſe, and diuers other Ladies, they paſſed away the time till the morning: at what time the Duke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, accompanied with many Lords &amp; Knights, with his owne hands buckled on theyr ſpurres, and then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth their ſwords, gaue them the gentle <hi>Accolado.</hi> Then rayſing them vp, deſired GOD to make them both good and valiant Knights. Then hearing deuine ſeruice, they returned into the great Hall, to make triall of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted Sword, where firſt the Prince <hi>Iago</hi> as the elder, made tryall, but by no meanes was able to draw it, then taking it to the Gentleman of the Forreſt, he ſaid, Brother God giue you better luck then I, or elſe this Squire is like to indure more labour. True replied he, &amp; I doubt it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſéeing that you haue miſt: then putting his hands on the Hilts, he drew it foorth as eaſily, as if it had béene an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſword, to the great wonder of the Duke, and all the beholders. Then the Squire falling on his knees, tolde him, that the boone which he required, was to goe into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with him, where he ſhould combat with a Knight, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſeſt Louer that might be: and therewith declared the whole diſcourſe of his Lady and <hi>Adreſto,</hi> as is before recited. Héere wee will leaue the Gentleman of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, preparing himſelfe to goe with the Squire into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to combat <hi>Adreſto,</hi> concluding the firſt part of our Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>And now all things béeing fitted in readineſſe for their departure, hee came before the Duke to take his leaue, where falling downe on his knées, proffering to kiſſe his graces hands, the Duke lift him vp from the ground, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him in his armes, and with teares trickling downe

               <p>Gentleman of the Forreſt, for ſonne I may no longer call you: the great loue which I haue alwaies borne vnto you, I am ſure you know to be no leſſe then that, either to
<pb facs="tcp:150602:50"/> your ſuppoſed brother the Prince <hi>Iago,</hi> or your ſiſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſena,</hi> although as by my former ſpéeches, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue you were not my owne naturall childe, but in your infancy found by my Lord the Duke in a Forreſt, in the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> of which place you haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince béene called the Gentleman of the Forreſt: no man knowing of what parentage you are diſcended, nor what other name then this, which the Duke gaue you to call you by. Theſe things I haue now thought good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you before your departure, that béeing abſent, you may the better if occaſion ſo happen, to find out your true and naturall parents, whom I doubt not but to be ſuch as your ſelfe ſhall haue no cauſe to grieue at, nor we cauſe to be ſorrowfull for the education beſtowed vpon you, your vertues already manifeſting the ſame.</p>
               <p>Farther would ſhe haue procéeded, but the teares trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe her chéekes, ſtopped the paſſage of her farther ſpéeches: when the young Knight hauing attentiuely liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto her former words, to the which thoſe of the Duke ſéemed to concure?</p>
               <p>Replied, moſt worthy Princeſſe, theſe your ſpéeches hath ſtrooke ſuch an amazedneſſe into my vnderſtanding, that I knowe not well what to ſpeake or thinke, but my vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe did alwaies foreſhowe, that I was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of ſo royall an ofſpring, as my Lord the Duke: yet notwithſtanding, my minde foretelleth me, I am not ſo baſely deſcended, but that I may hope for to challendge my ſelfe to be a Gentleman: and make knowne this high or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which my Lord the Duke hath beſtowed vpon mee of Knighthoode, not to ſurpaſſe my eſtate: wherefore I vow and proteſt before God, héere in your Graces preſence, not to reſt nor inioy quiet abode in any place, vntill ſuch time as I haue found out thoſe from whom I am deſcended. In the meane time, I humbly intreate you to eſtéeme of mée, though vnworthily as your faithfull and deuoted ſeruant: farther deſiring y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Princeſſe <hi>Egiſena,</hi> to honor me with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of being her Knight, vnder whoſe protection I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:150602:51"/> looke for ought other then good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>The Dutches being as ioyfull of this his concluſion, as ſorrowfull for his vowed determination, ſtood ſtill a while making no aunſwere at all. But at laſt being reſolued in her minde, that now or neuer it was time to follow her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed drift: fixed her eyes ſtedfaſtly on him, &amp; turning her ſpéeches to her daughter, ſayd. <hi>Egiſena,</hi> I perceaue now that which I alwaies feared is come to paſſe, concerning the loue betwéene you and this our new Knight, which ſince I perceaue to be true, and that to ſtriue againe deſtenie is booteleſſe, I both will and commaunde you, on paine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring my diſpleaſure, and by the natural loue you ought to beare me, I coniure you, not to conceale, but to make knowne vnto me, whether there be any ſuch loue-liking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene you, as outward ſhowes ſéeme to make manifeſt: which if there be, I will ſéeke ſome meanes to worke both your contents, which will be a cauſe to drawe this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the ſooner againe vnto this our Court.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe that had already béene inſtructed in her mothers drift, and being likewiſe thereunto of her ſelfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing, dying her chéekes with her maidenly bluſh, made her this aunſwere. Moſt gracious Princeſſe and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mother, I doe not well knowe whereunto theſe your ſpéeches may intend, conſidering that theſe vaine toyes of loue, as yet I was neuer acquainted with, but yet thus much I muſt néedes confeſſe, that the liking which I haue alwaies had to this Gentleman of the Forreſt, procéeded as I haue ſtill thought, from the naturall loue of a ſiſter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her brother: and ſince the knowing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hath continued, or I may ſay, bred a greater liking then to any other whatſoeuer: but not in ſuch ſort, as by making choiſe of him, either to diſpleaſe you or my father.</p>
               <p>The Knight being as ioyfull as might be, to heare them in theſe tearmes: for howſoeuer darkly ſhe ſpake, yet loue had ſo ſharpned his wits, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he geſſed very neere their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and comming to the Princeſſe kiſſed her hands for thoſe vnſéene kindneſſes, deſiring her in all humility, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:150602:51"/> him as her humble ſeruant, and faithfull Knight: in token whereof ſhe would beſtow ſome thing on him, which in all his aduentures might put him in minde of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, although her kind curteſies were already, ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his hart, as it was for euer impoſſible to bée worne out.</p>
               <p>Farther would he haue procéeded, but that the Squire earneſt of his Miſtriſſes charge, ſent vp to haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him away, which both the Dutches, and her daughter vnwilling to yéeld vnto, at laſt conſented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egiſena</hi> for a fauor deliuered him a faire Diamond, which alwaies ſhe worne on her finger. Thus taking his leaue of them, beeing accompanied with the Prince <hi>Iago,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other noble men, he was conuaied vnto the Sea-ſide, where they found his ſhip ready prouided, &amp; hauing winde at will, were ready to ſet ſaile. There he tooke his leaue of the Prince, and others his friends, imbracing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch ſhowes of ſorrowe, that cauſed the whole company and beholders, to dew their chéekes with teares. The Prince <hi>Iago</hi> many times intreating to accompanie him in his voyage, regarding more his company then his fathers diſpleaſure. But hee hauing determined a longer voyage in his minde: then ſuddenly to returne, would by no meanes conſent vnto the Princes requeſt. Thus at length, as each thing hath his time and end, ſéeing no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty would ſerue, hee committed him to the tuition of the almighty God, deſiring his proſperous and ſpéedie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Gentleman of the Forreſt, beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde, and hauing taken his leaue of the Prince, and the reſt of his friends, they ſet ſaile, hauing the wind fayre, and the Seas calme, euen as if <hi>Neptune</hi> had rouſed vp himſelfe to welcome ſome déere friend, the Dolphins, Porpiſes, and other ſtrange fiſhes, playing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the waters round about the Shippe, as béeing ſent of purpoſe to ſhewe pleaſure to the paſſengers: whereat our new Knight tooke no ſmall content. Thus paſſing away the time, ſomewhiles in beholding the fiſhes, and other ſea ſights, and in pleaſant and merry talke with the Pilot, and Maiſter of the Ship, concerning the cuſtomes and maners of the Seas, they ſayled by the ſpace of eyght dayes, with a proſperous and large wind, when towards the euening, the Maiſter looking abroad, to ſée whether he could diſcerne any land, happened to ſée in the Weſt north weſt, a ſmall clowde, riſing in manner of a mans hand, which the more he beheld, the blacker ſtill it ſéemed, which cauſed him to doubt ſome inſuing ſtorme: therefore willing his company to take in their top ſayles, and alſo to vnlace theyr drablets and bannets, determining to try with theyr Coſſes onely. Scarce had they obeyed halfe his commaundement, when the Sky béeing before very cléere, began to ouercaſt, and the winds to blow in ſuch ſort, that in leſſe ſpace then an houre, the Seas were growne ſo outragious, that it ſéemed euery billow ſtraue one with the other, which ſhould firſt boord their diſtreſſed burthen: the boat-ſwaine and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, indeuouring with all theyr might, to take in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſaile which they bare, and although it were but their coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet could they not doe it without great danger &amp; paine.
<pb facs="tcp:150602:52"/> Others found themſelues buſied in pomping and caſting foorth the water, each man imploying his beſt help for their liues ayde. And the Prince, although vnſkilfull, yet labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as hard as any of the reſt, ſometimes taking his turne at the pumpe, ſometimes to lift ouer-boord ſuch thinges, as might any waies be a hinderance, to the more light work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſhippe on the Seas: ſo that his labour was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable two waies, the one of it ſelfe, wherein he did aſmuch good as any man, the other his example, which cauſed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to be the more willing to performe their labor. Thus continued the ſtorme for the ſpace of two daies, to the great diſcomfort of all the company, but eſpecially of the Knight, who béeing ouertrauailed with labour, and his bodie not béeing to-fore vſed vnto the Sea, repaired into his Cabin, and caſting himſelfe on his bed, hoping to take ſome eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his reſtleſſe body: but ſléepe, the comforter of thoſe that are weary, yéelded him ſmall reliefe, for no ſooner were his eyes cloſed, but that the memory of the Princeſſe <hi>Egiſenas</hi> beauty repreſented it ſelfe vnto him: then would he conſider with himſelfe the likelihood of his obtaining her, as the great fauor which both the Duke her father alwaies ſhewed vnto him, and the kinde ſpéeches at their laſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, as alſo the vowed loue betwixt himſelfe, &amp; the Prince her Brother, which ſéemed to promiſe vnto him an aſſured obtayning. But on the contrary ſide, he would obiect his owne vnworthines, as béeing but peraduenture of baſe or meane Parentage, then the great &amp; mighty Princes which were deſirous of her loue: and laſt and not leaſt, that his abſence, (as oft times it dooth) in her likewiſe might breed forgetfulnes.</p>
               <p>Thus reuoluing many things in his mind, hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if God ſo pleaſed, after his enterpriſe againſt <hi>Adreſto</hi> ended, hee would trauell into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> hoping there to learne ſomewhat concerning his eſtate, or elſe peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to trauel along with the Squire &amp; <hi>Adreſto</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> where he doubted not but that <hi>Adriano</hi> ſhould reſolue him of that doubt. In this manner paſſed hee away moſt part
<pb facs="tcp:150602:53"/> of the night, till towards the morning, <hi>Morpheus</hi> pittying his reſtleſſe eſtate, cloſed his eyes, cauſing him to inioy a ſhort ſlumber. But long he had not ſlept, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee was awaked by a ioyfull cry, made by the whole company, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſight of Land: but the wind béeing come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward, they were forced to put in for a harbor, called at this day <hi>Milford-hauen,</hi> where comming aſhore, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to reſt themſelues, and prouide ſuch neceſſaries as they wanted, againſt the winde ſhould ſerue for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which from thence was but a ſhort cut.</p>
               <p>The next day, the Gentleman of the Forreſt beeing (as is before-ſaid) weary of the Sea, determined to goe recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelfe aſhore, wherefore taking his horſe and armor, accompanied onely with his Squire, he rode forth to view the Country, which he found to be indifferent fruitfull and pleaſant, but could ſée very few or no Inhabitants, which cauſed him not a little to meruaile: thus rode he on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of two leagues, beholding many goodly ſtreames, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſhadowes, the delight wherof, cauſed the way to ſéeme very ſhort. At length, comming to a ſmall Riuers ſide, hée alighted to reſt himſelfe, and deliuering his horſe to his Squire, hée layde himſelfe downe at the féete of a ſtatelie Béech trée, whoſe thicke branches were a ſhelter vnto him from the piercing heate of <hi>Phoebus</hi> golden rayes, where he was quickly luld aſléepe, with the chirping tunes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant birds, and bubling noyſe of the ſoft-ſlyding ſtreame. Long had hee not reſted in this pleaſant place, before ſuch time as he was wakened by a pittifull out-cry, and ſtarting vp halfe amazed, he beheld a moſt huge and mighty Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in forme ſomewhat bigger then a Cammell, his head and face not much vnlike a man, his mouth very large, as about a yard in widenes, his téeth vpwards of a foote long, his breaſt and foreféete, much like to a Lyon, his backe large and long, and for his hinder parts they were like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Beare: all his body béeing thicke ſet with briſtles, ſo hard as it was vnpoſſible for any ſword to pierce his ſkin. Which at the firſt ſight cauſed him to ſtand ſome what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:53"/> till perceiuing the Monſter almoſt to haue ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Squire, whom he purſued to haue deuoured, hee clapt on his Helme, and taking his Launce in his hand, he ranne to ſuccour him, and comming néere vnto him, ſmote the Monſter ſuch a blow, as well might haue ouerthrowne a good Knight, but to him it did no harme at all, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him greatly to doubt the iſſue of their conflict: the beaſt féeling himſelfe ſtriken behind, left the purſute of the ſquire, and turned about to the Knight, thinking to haue deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, and at the firſt layd hold on his ſhield with his two fore-feete, and with his mouth ſeaſed on his Helme, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame with his long téeth, to the no ſmall doubt and aſtoniſhment of the Knight, but as good hap was, he might then thank haſt, for in claſping on his Helme he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to faſten it, which was an occaſion, that at the firſt pul it came from his head, which otherwiſe would haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his braines. This hapned not a little to the aduantage of the Knight, who although his head were vnarmed, yet that want of Armor ſo armed the Monſters téeth, that for his life he could not cléere himſelfe thereof. Which gaue the Knight occaſion to make a full thruſt at his breaſt, where the ſkin béeing not ſo hard as in the other parts of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, gaue entrance to his truſtie blade, which pierced ſo déepe, that it cauſed great abundance of bloode to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: which the beaſt perceiuing, gaue a loude cry, and withall let goe his ſhield, and tooke holde on his left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, giuing him ſo kind a ſalutation with his ſharp nayles, that he brought away the armor and fleſh, hard to the bone, receiuing in the meane time a ſound blow on the deformed head, which cauſed him to réele backwards. But his ſkin was ſo hard, that it pierced no more then if hee had ſtriken vppon an Anuile of ſtéele. Thus continued they a great while, the Monſter ſtill aſſailing, and he auoyding, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his beſt aduantage to make thruſts, ſéeing blowes did nothing at all auaile. At length, beeing weary, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fainting by reaſon of his hurt, hee gaue backe a little to refreſh himſelfe, which the Monſter perceiuing, lay
<pb facs="tcp:150602:54"/> downe, and with his clawes ſought meanes to cléere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the Helme which hung faſt in his téeth, but before he was able to frée himſelfe thereof, the Knight who ſlacked not to take the leaſt aduantage that might be, gaue him ſo ſore a hurt in the belly, that it cauſed both his blood &amp; guts to iſſue out together, which the Monſter féeling, and ſtriuing to recouer himſelfe on his féete, ſtrained ſo much, that hee cauſed his helliſh ſoule to depart from his damned body.</p>
               <p>The Knight ſéeing himſelfe Victor, knéeled downe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly on the ground, rendring praiſe and thanks to the almighty GOD, for his proſperous and happy ſucceſſe in this his firſt enterpriſe. Then his Squire comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he made haſt to bind vp his wounds, and to depart towards his Ship, where hee might with more eaſe &amp; leſſe danger, be cured of his hurts, which grieued him not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eſpecially y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in his left ſhoulder. But before ſuch time as they were fully ready to depart, there came vnto them an old man, clothed like a Hermite, his head and beard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as white as milke, bearing in one hand a ſmall viole of water, and in the other a boxe of oyntment, and when hee came vnto them, he ſaluted them very curtiouſly, telling the Knight, that of long time he had expected his comming into that diſtreſſed place.</p>
               <p>The Knight as curteouſly regréeted him, &amp; afterwards demaunded, if he knew any place where he might be cured of ſome ſmall wounds which he had receiued, ſo which the Hermite replied, that within leſſe then halfe a league he had a ſmall Cell, whether if it pleaſed him to goe, he would not doubt but within few dayes to cure him: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, he would a little waſh and annoint the ſame, with ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and oyntment, as hee had for the ſame purpoſe brought with him, the Knight glad hereof, gaue him harty thanks, and hauing had his wounds dreſt, departed with him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Cell, where his wounds were cured, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you ſhall heare, with the occaſion of the Monſters bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that place.

               <p>Scarce were they entred one whole daies iourny with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this prouince, before that Fame, the Herault of reports, had brought vnto their eares, the cuſtome of the Caſtle of <hi>Coruew,</hi> with the many famous explots there exerciſed, with the innumerable number of Knights, which had there

               <p>Thus being agréed, tthe Lord of <hi>Menew</hi> went preſently vnto the ſhield, giuing it ſuch a blow that he cleft it in two in the midſt, which beeing ſéene by thoſe that garded the bridge, immediately one of them arming himſelfe, came foorth mounted on a mighty ſtéede, of a browne bay cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with a little white ſtarre in the forehead, and one white foote: and comming with an eaſie trot vnto the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> demaunded of him wherefore he ſought, and what was the occaſion of his ſo outragious ſtriking of the ſhield. The Lord of <hi>Menew</hi> aunſwered, that his comming thether was to ſéeke for a Knight, which bare in his ſhield two Lions rampant ſable, in a féeld argent, who as he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, had béene by treaſon ſubdued and impriſoned within that Caſtle, and for the ſtriking of the ſhield, hée liſted not to giue him any other reaſon, then that he hoped with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fame Launce, to pierce both his ſhield and his hart.

Then turning about his horſe, they both prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fetch their carrere: and placing their ſtaues in their reſts, they met together ſo rudely, that the Knight of the bridge was ſent to meaſure his length on the ground, being mortally wounded with a ſplinter of the Launce in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the Lord of <hi>Menew</hi> likewiſe, beeing ſo ſore ſhaken with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incounter, as he had much to doe to kéepe his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: then preſently came foorth other two Knights, well armed, and mounted, crying to him to prepare himſelfe to incounter them: which he preſently did, and méeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtrake one of them ſo ſtronge a blow, that miſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it with his ſhield, his Launce paſſed cleane through his body: but the other Knight, breaking his Launce in the midſt of his ſhield, cauſed him to tumble ouer his horſe taile, but it was not long before ſuch time as he had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his féete, his Squire beeing ready with the horſe of the firſt Knight, on which he preſently mounted, and drawing foorth his ſword, was preſently ready to aſſault the other, who ſéeing him diſmounted, made no great haſt, but with vaine glorious brauery, paſſed on his carrere, when tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about and perceauing him to bee remounted, drew foorth his ſword, ſaying, Sir Knight, well may you thanke your Squire for ſo quicke puruaying of a new horſe for you, but I feare me hee ſhall but little ſtéede you againſt the force of my arme, which hath once already ſent you to meaſure your loutiſh length vpon the ground.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> being madded with rage, ſtayed not to aunſwere him with words, but with his ſword lent him ſo friendly a blow, that cauſed him to bend his head e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to his breſt: but quickly recouering himſelfe againe, he ſtrake the other ſuch ablow, that had hee not warded the
<pb facs="tcp:150602:56"/> ſame with his ſhield, he had gone néere to haue cleft his head in two: thus continued they a while, ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other ſéeming to haue the better, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo equally guiding the ballance, that it was hard to iudge, whether ſide ſhould obtaine victory. At laſt, the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> imagining with himſelfe that to be long in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, would be a cauſe that himſelfe in the end ſhould be ouercome, determined either to obtaine a ſpéedy conqueſt, or a ſpéedy death: wherefore, vniting all his forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and raiſing himſelfe in his ſtirrups, hee gaue his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie ſuch a recombendibus on the head, that the ſtéele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of too weake a force to reſiſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weight thereof, gaue frée paſſage to the ſword, which found a ready way to his braines, cauſing him to fall as dead as a herring vnto the ground.</p>
               <p>But before he could haue any ſpace to reſt himſelfe, or almoſt to breath, came foorth other two, charging him both at once, and he as gallantly aunſwered their charge, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both their ſtaues vppon his ſhield, which cauſed his horſe a little to ſtagger backwards, but as they paſſed by, their Launces being broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he gaue one of them ſo ſound a ſtroke on the ſide of the head, before hée looked for any ſuch matter, that he left him but halfe a face to court his Miſtris withall: then prouiding to incounter the other, betwixt whom there paſſed a fierce and bloody conflict, but in the end the victory remained vnto the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee were grieuouſly wounded, yet his hart being not a whit feared or any way diſmaied, went forwards vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bridge, whether Sir <hi>Henault</hi> likewiſe came, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to giue ouer the enterpriſe to him, conſidering he was ſo ſore hurt, but he that neuer knew what feare was, could not be ſo lightly perſwaded, wherefore deſiring Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> if he were ouercome to do his beſt, he made choice of ſuch parts of armes as he wanted, and taking a ſtronge Launce, he went forwards towards the end of the bridge, where he was incountred by two of the fiue Knights that kept the ſame, betwixt whom there was a long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb facs="tcp:150602:56"/> conflict, but in the end, through faintneſſe and great loſſe of blood, the Lord of <hi>Menew</hi> ſtriking a full blow at one of them, ſent himſelfe after to the ground, his legges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer able to ſuſtaine the weight of his body, yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby the victory to them, who were not able long to inioy the ſame: for the one of them euen as he fell, being in as weake eſtate, ſtrooke likewiſe at him, and miſſing his blow, ſent the whole burthen of his body to imbrace him in death, whom in life he had perſued ſo deadly. The other likewiſe being in little better ſtate, ſeeing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion fall, thought to helpe him, and ſtooping downe to lift him vp, fell himſelfe likewiſe into a traunce.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henault</hi> fearing leaſt his companion had béen ſlaine, went preſently to haue taken vp his body, but was hindred by the other thrée Knights: who all at once aſſaulted him, and being afoote in like ſort as he was, there beganne a bloody, though vnequall combat, each party ſéeking to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Thus fought they a long time, giuing and receauing many wounds: Sir <hi>Henault</hi> giuing ſuch blowes, as well made ſhow he meant to ſell his liberty or life at a déere rate: ſo long they fought, that at length two of them fell dead at his féete, the other ſéeing his fellowes ſlaine, thought it more for his liues ſafety to truſt to his legges then his hands, ſo that turning his backe he ranne towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, from whence preſently iſſued, fiue other Knights ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, putting themſelues betwéene Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> and the runne-away.</p>
               <p>Héere againe beganne a more fierce conflict then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by reaſon they were fiue hardy approoued Knights, and his former battaile hauing ſerued, but as whetting of his courage, cauſed him to lay on ſuch blowes, that in ſhort time he had ſent two of their ſoules to ſéeke paſſage at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> ferry: himſelfe and the other thrée being greatly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſtoode ſtill a while to reſt themſelues: when Sir <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault</hi> conſidering with himſelfe the cauſe of his fighting, as to releaſe his noble friend <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> and alſo to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the death of the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> hee was ſo repleat
<pb facs="tcp:150602:57"/> with ire, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> running vpon them as a man inraged, he ſtrooke one of them ſuch a blow, as he ſeuered his head from his ſhoulders, then laying on at the other two ſuch mighty blowes, that hee forced them in the end to yéeld vp their ſoules, as a ſacrifice to his ſword: which being ended, hée himſelfe being-ouer trauelled, and hauing loſt great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood, ſate himſelfe downe on a ſtone, where hée had not long ſitten before he fel into aſwound, which being ſéene by the Knights of the Caſtle, they came foorth and tooke both him, and the body of the Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> with the reſt of whom there was any hope of recouery, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them into the Caſtle, where in reſpect of their vallor, they cauſed to be carefully attended, and their wounds to be cured: perſwading them in the meane time to bee part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, in garding this their lewd cuſtome.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Gentleman of the Forreſt, beeing brought by the Hermit and his Squire vnto the Hermitage, he was forthwith diſarmed, and layd on a ſilly coutch, on which the olde Hermit vſed to lie, and béeing carefully loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto, and attended on by the Hermit, within 3. dayes hée was indifferently well recouered, and ſitting vp in his bed, he deſired the old man to declare vnto him, as hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had promiſed, the diſcourſe of the Monſter which hee had killed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150602:57"/>
               <p>The old man glad to ſée him ſo well recouered, and alſo deſirous to pleaſure him in any thing he could, began thus. Moſt worthy Knight, not long ſince there was remaining in this Country, a moſt vile and wicked Gouernour, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Querenus,</hi> a man for the deteſtable wickednes which he liued in, hated both of God and man, for what virgin or beautifull wife was there in this Country, which if hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but he would force to accompliſh his luſtfull appetite: yea to ſuch a height of euill was he growne, that he neither feared God nor man, knowing no heauen but his worldlie pleaſures, nor fearing no other hell but the miſery of this life, the which hee continued to the mortall griefe of all his ſubiects: who in the end, béeing wearied and ouerburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this intollerable miſerie, choſe rather to end theyr liues ſpéedily, then continually to be tormented by this blood-thirſtie Tyrant. Wherefore gathering themſelues together, they made head againſt the Tyrant, and after a long warre, they preuailed ſo againſt him, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſecretly to abandon his Country, and béeing onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two men, taking a ſmall boate, which hée found ready prouided, fled away to the Sea, where hauing béen ſome fixe dayes, at laſt was put a ſhore in an Iland, not farre diſtant hence, where in times paſt, the excellent and famous Magitian <hi>Bardus</hi> ſometimes dwelt, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing landed, and calling to minde the eſtate which hee now was brought into, determined there to take vp his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to preuent both himſelfe and his company, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope or deſire to eſcape, immediatly ſuncke the boate wherein they had eſcaped, and afterward, béeing diligently ſearching in a certaine Caue, hapned to find diuers bookes of Magicke, which he tooke great delight in, minding to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and practiſe the ſame. And ſo mightily profited he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that in very ſhort time he grew very expert in the ſame: and at length, growing old, and calling to mind his former life paſt, and conſidering the wrong which hee thought he had ſuſtained by his ſubiects, it cauſed him to determine how to be reuenged on them, which in this ſort he brought
<pb facs="tcp:150602:58"/> to paſſe.</p>
               <p>There is in the weſtermoſt parts of <hi>America,</hi> a ſmall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land very fruitfull, but whether by nature, or by ſome other accident, or determination of Fortune, onely inhabited by diuers huge and execrable Monſters, there-hence by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiliſh Art, did this vngodly <hi>Querenus</hi> cauſe to be brought the huge monſter, which you to your endleſſe honour haue ſo valiantly ſlaine: and placing him héere, by that meanes thought fully to be reuenged, where by the ſpace of twenty yéeres hee hath now remained, to the vtter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this Country, laying it vtterly waſt and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, hauing deuoured ſo many Chriſtian bodies, that it grieues my very ſoule to thinke of, no man before this your comming, euer daring to aduenture himſelfe againſt him, although many times there hath many great companies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues, to haue aſſailed him, but comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, the very ſight of him hath put them in ſuch a feare, as not able to indure, they haue béen forced to turne their backs and flie, truſting more to their héeles then their hands, many of them béeing not able to flie ſo faſt as theyr fellowes, where forced to ſtay behind, &amp; remaine as foode vnto the vgly Monſter: but now (God be thanked) by your noble proweſſe, brought vnto his end.</p>
               <p>The Prince receiued no ſmall admiration heereat, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that a man ſhould be ſo wicked, as to reuenge his wrong by ſo hatefull a meanes. But to bring him out of this his imaginations, the Hermit would diſcourſe with him of diuers other matters, ſometimes of one matter, and then of another. And now the Knight hauing remained by the ſpace of tenne dayes in the Hermitage, he was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wel recouered, during which time he was many times viſited by his owne company, and alſo by the inhabitants of the Country, which came daily to ſée him. For by this time had Fame ſo ſpred abroade his hautie exployt, that there came many from diuers Countries adioyning, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues, and all that they had to be at his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but he béeing not minded to ſtay there longer then that
<pb facs="tcp:150602:58"/> his wounds were throughly whole, gaue them thankes for their kind proffer, telling them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee could not accept of the the ſame, by reaſon he was to follow a certaine earneſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture which he was in queſt of. Thus paſſing away the time vntill he was fully whole, the day before he meant to depart towards his ſhip, the old Hermit being in talk with him, told him of a certaine aduenture not farre of, which in his younger yéeres, he did remember to haue ſéene many to make tryall thereof, but neuer heard of any to haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the accompliſhment of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Knight béeing deſirous to know the ſame, deſired the Hermit to declare it vnto him, which he did in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Not far hence (quoth he) there ſtandeth a ſmall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſituate at the foote of an hill, nowe altogether ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with bryers and buſhes, by reaſon of the Monſters crueltie, which lately to your eternall renowne, you ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly haue vanquiſhed and ſlaine: in former time this Chappell was dedicated to the diuine ſeruice of GOD, by the renowned King <hi>Flintus,</hi> Prince of the Brittons, in the time that the Romans ruled héere with their mighty Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and afterwards beautified and adorned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous Prince <hi>Lionell</hi> his ſonne, with many ſumptious and coſtlie ornaments. In the midſt of which a little before his death, he cauſed his owne Armor, being one of the beſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and with which hee had accompliſhed many excellent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuements, to be hanged vp there, to be kept for his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall memory. Where it remained a great while vntouched of any, onely through the priuiledge of the place, vntill the time of the famous <hi>Arthur,</hi> at which time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>Merlin</hi> knowing that there would be many, which not reſpecting the ſinne of ſacriledge, would not ſtick to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſo precious a Iewell as was the ſame, caſt foorthwith ſo mighty an inchauntment on the Armor, that none but ſuch a one, who in his time ſhould excell all others, both in valour, curteſie and loyaltie, ſhould be able to take downe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now not long after, according to his imagination it fell
<pb facs="tcp:150602:59"/> out, for many béeing deſirous to obtaine ſo good an Armor, made tryall to take the ſame away, but hetherunto there was no man ſo hardy, as once to moue it. Wherfore I am fully perſwaded, that it was ordained onely for you, in whom I may boldly ſay, remaines the greateſt vallor and magnanimitie, that may be poſſible in any Knight now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as already your déedes haue manifeſted. The prince thanking him for his vndeſerued prayſes, attributing them rather to his loue and affection towards him, then for any merrite he knew in himſelfe worthy the leaſt of them: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſiring the good olde man, to accompany him thether, where he would likewiſe make triall of his fortune, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others had doone before him, albeit he had no hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that, which ſo many good Knights had failed of.</p>
               <p>Thus departing from the Hermitage, they went the next way towards the Chappell, where they arriued about the time they were wont to ſing their euening Maſſe there, at their comming they found it deſolate, the doores &amp; win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ouer-growne with bryers and nettles, the walls ruinous, and all things elſe growne into decay, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not onely the auncient Hermit, but alſo the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſhed teares from theyr eyes. Then at the requeſt of the Prince, the Hermit ſang Euen ſong vnto them, which had not béen heard there in twenty yéeres before.</p>
               <p>Theyr prayers béeing ended, they went vp in a ſmall Ile of the Chappell, where hung the foreſaid Armor, with diuers other Reliques, which hee beheld, with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to inioy the ſame: then lifting vp his eyes to heauen, imploring God to be his ayde, he ſtretched foorth his hand to take them downe from their place; which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> without any paine at all, to the no ſmall admiration of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Then pulling of his owne Armor, he armed himſelfe with this which he had gotten, which fitted him ſo well, as if it purpoſely had béene made for him. The Armor was of a greene cullour, repreſenting a fielde full of Orenge trees bearing fruite, ſome fallen, ſome ripe as ready to fall, and ſome againe gréene, as but now budding, which wrought
<pb facs="tcp:150602:59"/> ſuch a content vnto the Princes minde, as not any thing might be greater. The ſhield alſo he tooke on his arme, and although it was imperſable, yet was it framed of ſuch a ſubſtance, that it was as light as any ordinary ſhield, the deuice béeing in a fielde <hi>Verte,</hi> thrée Lyons rampant, or ſignifying indéede, thrée Lyons which the famous <hi>Lyonell</hi> ſlew in the Kingdome of <hi>Spayne,</hi> as you may reade in that Hiſtory, and from which likewiſe hee was called <hi>Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queller.</hi>

The Damſell béeing comforted with this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, roſe vp from the ground, and wiping the teares from her eyes, began thus.

               <p>But alas héere began the head or ſpring of all my griefe, as by the ſequell of my ſpéeches you ſhall perceiue, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt this company, there was a Knight whoſe liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ioyned with ours, a man indued with rites ſufficient, had the Gods graced him ſo well with vertue and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. This Knight, I ſay, fayning himſelfe to be atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with my beauty, deſired mee of my mother in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. But ſhe reſpecting more the riches of the mind, then the worldly wealth of the man, gaue him a flat deniall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging my youth to be ſuch, as was very vnfit for a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: and that to match a young gerle without a ſetled affection, was the next way to leade her into a life farre worſe then death: for then to be matched where one cannot loue, there is on earth no greater torment.</p>
               <p>Hée taking this deniall in very ill part, departed vnto his owne Caſtle, béeing not paſſing thrée leagues of, where hée remained awhile, contemplating reuenge in his hart, and deuiſing by what meanes he might accompliſh the ſame, at laſt determined to winne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by force, which by fayre means he could not hope to attaine. And béeing ſetled in this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he gathered together the greateſt forces y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee could: and within a month after, no one ſuſpecting ſuch villanie, in the night time moſt trayterouſly aſſaulted our Caſtle, where hauing gotten the poſſeſſion thereof, ſlew all thoſe who made any reſiſtance againſt him. And taking my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her Chamber, threatned her with ſhe like crueltie as hee had ſhewed vnto the reſt, if foorthwith ſhée did not giue me her wofull daughter, to be his Concubine: for now hauing gotten our poſſeſſions by force, he diſdained to haue me to his wife, which I béeing in the next réeme and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, immediatly threw my ſelfe out at a window, where
<pb facs="tcp:150602:61"/> by chance faling to the ground without any great hurt, I found his Palfry ready tide, on which foorthwith I moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, flying away as faſt as I could, neuer ſtaying in any place, vntill now méeting with you, of whom I hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue helpe and comfort.</p>
               <p>Hare ſhe ſtayed her ſpéeches, pouring foorth abundance of teares, which cauſed the young Knight greatly to pittie her: vowing vnto her, if that they remained his comming, he would ſo puniſh theyr deteſtable treaſons, as ſhould be both to her content, and alſo an example to all thoſe, who ſhould afterward attempt the like. And willing her to leade on the way, they rode onwards moſt part of the day, not méeting with any one till euening, about the time that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperus</hi> appearing in the Weſt, gaue them warning to take vp theyr lodging, which forthwith they did: for comming into a little thicke wood, and the Sky waxing dark, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they feared to miſſe theyr way, they layde themſelues downe vnder a thicke tuffe of trées, where after they had refreſhed themſelues, with ſuch viands as his Squire had brought with him, they betooke themſelues to ſléepe, the Prince not ſo much as putting off his Helme, for feare leaſt they might be ſet on in their ſléepe: and hee alſo appointed the two Squires to watch by turne, ſo much did his mind miſdoubt the wickednes of thoſe people, who inhabited thereabouts, giuen onely to rapine and theft.</p>

               <p>And truly afterwards he did not repent the ſauing of his life, for that he did him good ſeruice, as you ſhall reade in the ſequell of the Hiſtory.

Then placing theyr ſtaues in theyr reſts, they ranne one againſt the other with all their forces, and méeting together, theyr incounter was ſo furious, that <hi>Callapin</hi> was throwne to the ground being verie ſore bruſed with the fall.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is declared in the firſt part of this hiſtory, how that Prince <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> being in the <hi>French</hi> Court, where he ouercame the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and after maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> to be the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Lady in the world, of whom hee grew ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured, that hee determined to demaunde her of the King her father. Wherefore one day being in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly humor, walking in a delightfull garden, ioyning to the Pallace to recreate himſelfe, the King likewiſe came thether, being accompanied with one page only, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prince ſomewhat penſiue, demaunded the cauſe thereof: to which he replied. The cauſe of this my dumpes, in which you ſay I now am in, procéedes partly from your ſelfe, in regard I feare your deniall in a matter, for which I minde to be a ſuter vnto you: which feare driues me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a doubt, whether I were beſt to ſpeake in the ſame, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bee denayd, or elſe conceals the ſame to my ſelfe, which likewiſe may bréede a farther danger.</p>
               <p>The King a while ſtudying with himſelfe, what the matter might be, at length gaue him this aunſwere. Moſt noble Prince, the loue which I bare vnto you is ſuch, that it cauſeth me not to diſſemble with you, wherefore knowe that I cannot chuſe but take theſe your ſpéeches, in very vnkind part, howſoeuer by you ſpoken: for if the matter be reaſonable which you would requeſt, then how farre you wrong mee in doubting my conſent therein, I referre to God only, who knowes the thoughts of my hart. If vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, to your ſelfe, who knowes what it is from ones friend to expect thoſe things, which hee cannot well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:150602:64"/> his great preiudice graunt: wherefore declare boldly what it is that troubles your minde, and aſſure your ſelfe, you ſhall finde me willing to ſatiſfie you therein, if it bée not greatly to the preiudice of my honor, and ſtate of this my Kingdome. The Prince hearing this friendly, and to him ioyfull concluſion: replied, that he did greatly thanke his Maieſtie, for that great loue which hee did aſſure him of: wherefore now putting all feare and doubte aſide, hée would declare the ſame vnto him, which was this: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly wounded with the vertues, and beauty of the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia</hi> his daughter, whom in hart he had vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to loue, and fearing leaſt he had otherwiſe diſpoſed of her, indéede was the cauſe of his penſiueneſſe.</p>
               <p>Which when the King heard, with a ſmiling counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made him this aunſwere: and is it poſſible, that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can cauſe ſuch alteration in you, or elſe that loue can ſo ſoone take poſſeſſion of your hart, as comming frée to this my Court, where you haue ſcarcely remained one month: but indéede your combat with the Duke our Coſin, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hazarding your ſelfe in the ſame Challenge, did cauſe me, in ſort to imagine, that you were ſomewhat intangled in thoſe nets.</p>
               <p>But now to the purpoſe, as ſhe is my daughter, ſo doe I thinke ſhee will not make her choiſe without my conſent, neither I being her father, will force her conſent where ſhe doth not loue, but if by faire meanes ſhee may be wonne héereunto, aſſure your ſelfe, that the houſe of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> is moſt willing to linke it ſelfe in loue and amitie with the Prince of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe noble vallour, deſerues to bée highly had in eſtimation.</p>
               <p>The Prince for this his kinde graunt, would néedes haue kiſt his royall hands, which the King would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to doe, but imbracing him in his armes, departed immediately into the Pallace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Queenes chamber of preſence, called for the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> and willing all ſaue the Quéene, and her to a voyd the preſence, hee demaunded of her, whether
<pb facs="tcp:150602:65"/> there were any loue betwéene her and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince: at which demaunde, ſhe dying her Princely chéekes with a maidenly bluſh, and falling on her knées, aunſwered. Moſt gracious father, conſidering that in concealing the truth from you, being therof demaunded, I ſhall not only breake the bounds of duty by being diſobedient, but alſo offende God in making of a lie: know therefore, that ſince the day wherein he ouercame the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> I haue ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled my ſelfe in his loue, which before being by him ſued vnto I made ſcorne of, that I can finde no way to alter the ſame, but by death only, which rather then it ſhould be to your diſlike, I would willingly indure were it neuere ſo cruell.</p>
               <p>The King beeing ioyfull héereat, yet ſéeming to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, ſaid: In faith and is it poſſible, that thou moſt fond and fooliſh gearle, ſhouldeſt ſo much forget the bounds of dutie and vertue, as without my conſent, ſo to ſettle thy fancie on a ſtranger: but I doubt not but thou wilt as ſoone repent thy choiſe, as thou haſt forgotten thy duty in chooſing, for who knowes whether he being a young amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, hath not made ſome other choiſe already, where then are thy hopes, or what will become of thy loue. The Princeſſe hearing her father in theſe tearmes, knewe not well what aunſwere to make, but at length with teares in her eies, and fetching a déepe ſigh from her hart, ſhée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to conſider ſhe force and power of loue, which was of ſuch might, that who moſt ſought to ſtriue againſt it, was the more cruelly therewith in the end wounded: and that as yet her loue being knowne to none, ſéeing it ſo greatly diſliked his Maieſtie, ſhe would for euer kéepe cloſe, although it did coſt her, her life: which ſhée was ſure it would doe, ſéeing it had taken already ſuch déepe rooting in her hart. The King ſéeing her conſtancie, &amp; loth to grieue her any farther, tooke her by the arme, &amp; raiſing her from the ground, bid her to be of good comfort, for ſéeing that her affection procéeded from vertue, and not of any wanton or luſtfull appetite, hee did both alowe of it, and yéeld conſent
<pb facs="tcp:150602:65"/> vnto the choiſe which ſhe had made, willing her farther, to eſtéeme of the Prince, as one who not only déerely loued her, but alſo was worthy to be beloued, both for his vallor &amp; magnanimitie of mind, of the greateſt Lady in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Thus leauing her not a little comforted, he went to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the ſame to the Prince, vnto whom this newes was more welcome, then to haue béene made Lord of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Kingdome of the world. And taking order with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King for the day of their marriage, againſt which time there ſhould be prepared a great Turny, hee alſo ſent ouer into <hi>England</hi> the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to certifie the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther héereof, which was to him moſt welcome newes, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now greatly ſtriken in yeares. Alſo there were many Heraults ſent foorth to proclaime this great Turny, which ſhould beheld in the Citty of <hi>Parris,</hi> at the nuptials of the Prince of <hi>England,</hi> and the beautifull <hi>Emelia:</hi> againſt which time there came daily, many braue and gallant Knights, from diuers Kingdomes, as well Chriſtians as Saraſines: for that the King had graunted by his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, a ſafe conduct for all commers.</p>
               <p>Now in this meane time, the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> being throughly recouered of his wounds, which he had receaued againſt <hi>Don Edward,</hi> and finding that with the loſſe of his honor, he had likewiſe loſt his loue, grew therewith into ſo great rage, that he would haue ſlaine himſelfe, had it not béene for ſome of his ſeruants, who alwaies gaue dilligent attendance vnto him: and deuiſing with himſelfe on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, at laſt reſolued by vnknowne trechery, to bring it thus to paſſe. There was in this his Dukedome a great Inchaunter, who with his accurſed ſpells, was able in a manner to pull the ſtarres out of their places: to this man the Duke reſorted, and making him priuie to his intent, deſired him to deuiſe ſome meanes how vnknowne hée might be reuenged on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince. The Inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter willing to ſhowe his loue vnto the Duke, immediately deuiſed a meane, how not only to be reuenged on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:66"/> but alſo on as many as were welwillers vnto him: which he did bring to paſſe in this ſort. There was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kingdom of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> ſome tenne leagues from <hi>Parris</hi> a great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in which this Inchaunter by his deuiliſh art, erected a ſtately Caſtle inuironed about with high walls, &amp; déepe ditches, ſo as it ſéemed one of the ſtrongeſt, and faireſt Caſtles of the Kingdome: likewiſe he inchaunted it in ſuch ſort, that though a thouſand Knights had ſought for it, yet notwithſtanding there ſhould none haue found the ſame, but ſuch as they thought ſhould not be of ſuch force, as to conquer the gardants, who were two fierce &amp; mighty Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, farre excéeding the common ſtature of others of that kind. Alſo there was a Knight a kinſman of the Dukes, who being acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with 20 or 30 attendants, alwaies remained héerein: the Giants who kept the gard, the one of them was called <hi>Brandofell,</hi> with him firſt muſt thoſe Knights haue to doe, that came to make triall of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, the other was named <hi>Furioll,</hi> excelling in ſtrength all the Giants of his time, to him belonged the combat with thoſe Kinghts, to whom fortune was ſo fauorable, as to ouercome <hi>Brandofell.</hi> In this manner hauing prouided for the garde of this inchaunted Caſtle, they deuiſed a meane by which to bring the Prince vnto the ſame, which was in this manner. The Inchaunter <hi>Liguſtargo,</hi> for ſo was he called, had a daughter indifferent faire, who in diſſimulation was as ſkilfull, as her father in the art of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, for ſhe had her teares at commaund, and could ſo well frame her countenance to ſorrowe, that there was none but would haue taken her to be very ſorrowe it ſelfe: to her was referred the meanes to ſeduce the Prince, who comming vnto the Court, with her haire diſperſſed about her ſhoulders, her garments rent and torne, and beeing conducted into the great Hall, ſhe was admired at of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, and greatly pittied, for the outward ſhowe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, which did ſéeme ſo much to afflict her: in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being conducted where the King, with many Princes

Now let vs returne to our
<pb facs="tcp:150602:67"/> former purpoſe: the next day, no ſooner had the Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of Dame <hi>Thetis</hi> lodging, mounted himſelfe on his neuer reſting Chariot, but the valerous Prince being accompaned with the Damſell, and one Squire only, for more company he would not accept of, armed at all points ſauing his Helme, which his Squire carried by reaſon of the heate: tooke his iourny towards the vnfortunate For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Moſt part of the day rode they onwards, the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell for the better hiding of her trechery, declared vnto him a large diſcourſe, of the loue betwéene the Dutches her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Miſtriſſe, and the Knight <hi>Sergando,</hi> with many his valerous and hauty déedes of armes, whereof ſome part the Prince had heard of, which cauſed him to giue the more credit to the reſt. Thus paſſed they away all that day, till comming vnto a ſmall village, ſome two leagues diſtant from the Forreſt, euen about the time, that <hi>Phoebus</hi> with his golden beames, was ſome thrée degrées diſcended from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Meridian: and becauſe it was too late to combat with the Giant, they determined for that night to take vp their reſt, whereby the next day hee might not be altogether wearied with trauell, and alſo to haue if occaſion ſerued, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time to finiſh the combat. Thus hauing taken vp their lodgings in a ſmall cottage, they refreſhed themſelues with ſuch viands as that Country village would afford: and after their repaſt, betaking themſelues to their reſt, where the Prince of all the night could ſcarcely inioy one ſlumber, till towards the morning clooſing his eyes, he ſlumbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little, in which hee thought that hee came before a goodly Caſtle, one of the faireſt that euer he beheld, hauing but one entraunce which was at a ſmall wicket, through which it ſéemed vnto him, he ſaw very many enter, but none to returne backe againe, at which hee ſéemed very much to meruaile, and going about to enter, he ſaw a mighty Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant comming vnto him, the which ſight ſo amazed him, that foorthwithall he wakened. And bleſſing himſelfe, called his Squire vnto him, and demaunding whether it were day or no, he roſe &amp; armed himſelfe: then taking a ſmall repaſt, he
<pb facs="tcp:150602:68"/> departed towards the Forreſt, where hee arriued by the time that the ſplendant Sunne with his gliſtring beames, beganne to light the earth, cauſing a ſiluer ſhowe appeare on the face thereof.</p>
               <p>Long had hee not rode in this Forreſt, (muſing verie much what his dreame ſhould meane, ſometimes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that it foreſhewed ſome great miſaduenture to inſue, then wiſhing his dreame had continued, whereby he might haue had ſome notice of the end, as well as of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) but the Damſell calling vnto him, told him, that now they were come euen vnto the place where the Gyant had robbed her, &amp; that ſhe doubted he was not farre of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling for his Helme, and claſping it on, taking his Launce in his hand, behold there appeared before his ſight the ſame Caſtle, which in his dreame hee thought hee had ſéene: and caſting about his head, he ſaw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming towards him a mighty Giant, the greateſt of ſtature that euer he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, mounted on a Courſer aunſwerable to his weight, which cauſed the Prince at the firſt almoſt to be afraid, yet well conſidering the vſuall vnluſtineſſe of thoſe huge mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, he tooke courage vnto him, minding to doe his vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to win himſelfe immortall fame, by vanquiſhing ſo huge a lumpe.</p>
               <p>The Giant comming néere vnto him, bidde him prouide himſelfe for the Combat, for that without leaue hee was come ſo néere vnto theyr Caſtle whereof he was appointed Gardant. The Prince immediatly replied, that ſéeing hée was by aduenture come thether, and béeing offred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which he was ſure would bréede him immortall fame, he could doe no leſſe then accept therof. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſetting ſpurres to their horſes, and placing their ſlaues in their reſts, they met together with ſuch furie, that breaking theyr Launces into a thouſand ſhyuers, they mette with theyr bodies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe together ſo furiouſly, that they tumbled both horſe and men to the ground, béeing both greatly aſtonied with theyr rude incounter: and riſing from the ground, they betooke them to theyr ſwords, the Giant drawing forth a mightie
<pb facs="tcp:150602:68"/> Semiter, as much as another reaſonable Knight with one hand was able to lift from the ground: and brandiſhing the ſame about his head, began to deliuer many mighty blows at his enemie, which the Prince perceiuing, and fearing greatly to indure the ſame, not being by force able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame, auoyded them by the quicknes of his body, cauſing him to ſpend his might in vaine, and many times did hee both with thruſts and blowes indanger his mightie aduerſarie, although his Armor were of pure ſtéele well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>néere a finger thicke, which the Giant perceiuing, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with growing inraged, hee determined with one blowe to end the conflict, and lifting vp his Semiter aloft, made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of a blowe, which the Prince thought to take on his ſhield, hoping to haue giuen him a wound in one of his legs in the meane time, as indéede he did, but the Giant hauing by this meanes a full blow at him, lighted vpon his ſhield, cleauing it in two peeces, and paſſing farther, entering through both his Helme and coyſe of ſtéele, wounded him in the head, cauſing him to réele backwards halfe aſtoniſhed therewith: but yet recouering himſelfe before the Gyant could deliuer another blow, determined with the ſkilfull Maſſiue, who béeing once toſſed to his dammage, by the horne of the ſturdy Bull, minding no more ſo to indanger himſelfe with the like, begins to lie low on the ground, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hoping both to auoyde his enemies might, and eake to be ready to take the leaſt aduantage when it ſhould be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: euen ſo playd the valiant Prince, who to his coſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made tryall of his enemies ſtrength, determined no more to hazard himſelfe to the like, truſted wholy to the quickneſſe of his body, which pollicie ſerued him to good vſe, for thereby he cauſed the hudge monſter, not onely to weary out himſelfe, by his multitude of blowes which hee beſtowed in vaine, but alſo many time had the meanes, to giue him diuers great wounds, cauſing his blood to iſſue out in ſuch abundant ſort, that the gréene graſſe was dyed into a vermilion bluſh, as béeing aſhamed, that humane men ſhould haue ſo little reaſon, as to ſéeke the ruine and
<pb facs="tcp:150602:69"/> ouerthrow of each other, vpon ſo ſmall occaſion.</p>
               <p>Thus continued the fight moſt part of the day, no one knowing to whom victory would attaine, both of them bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded in many parts of their bodies, eſpecially the Giant, who by reaſon of the great effuſion of blood, which he ſuſtained, began to beare his ſhielde low, and euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt breathleſſe, the Prince béeing in little better caſe, was contented to ſuffer him to take breath: and leaning awhile on theyr ſwords, the Giant told the Prince, that if he would yéeld vnto him, he would cauſe him to be vſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lenitie, otherwiſe, hee ſhould expect nought ſaue death. To which the Prince made no reply, but willing the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to defend himſelfe, they renewed theyr Combat, which continued awhile with great fierceneſſe on both ſides. But at length, the Giant béeing ouer-wearied, and fainting for want of blood, began againe to giue backe, which the prince perceiuing, and conſidering that to be long in conquering, would be the meanes that hee himſelfe in the end ſhould be vanquiſhed, tooke Time by the front, and purſuing the Giant, gaue him ſuch a blow on the Helme, that it cauſed him to réele: and before he could recouer himſelfe, hee gaue him another, which cauſed him to fall to the ground. The Prince minding to follow his good fortune, ſtooped to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace his Helme, whereby he might haue parted his head fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſhoulders: but héereof hee was hindred by the mightie <hi>Purioll,</hi> who comming vnto him, willed him to giue ouer the vanquiſhed, and to defend himſelfe againſt the force of his arme.</p>
               <p>The Prince looking about, and beholding his terrible countenaunce and geſture, began greatly to doubt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that already hee was ouer-wearied with his former Combat: then calling to mind the wordes of the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia</hi> at his departure, he wiſked he had béen ruled by her counſell, which if hee had followed, hee had not fallen into this vnlooked for miſchiefe. And now againe caſting of all feare, the Giant béeing come néere vnto him, he minded to ſell his life and liberty at as déere a rate at he could, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb facs="tcp:150602:69"/> if he could, to prolong the fight as long as he might, hoping in the end to weary out that Giant, as he had doone <hi>Brandofell,</hi> but héereof he was deceiued, by reaſon that his wearines, together with his loſſe of blood, had ſo taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the agilitie and quicknes of his body, that he was not able to auoyde the blowes ſo lightly, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Giant many times met with him, cauſing the blood to iſſue forth in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places: and againe, his ſtrength was ſo diminiſhed, that he could not (if at any time by aduantage hee hapned to ſtrike the Giant) ſo much as once pierce his maſſy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. Thus continued they by the ſpace of halfe an howre, the Prince euer receiuing wound vppon wound, vntill at length, béeing altogether wearied with his ouer-long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, (as hauing continued in fight from ſeauen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clocke in the morning, vntill fiue in the afternoone, and hauing loſt great aboundance of blood,) gathered all his forces togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and minding before hee died, to indamage his enemie what he could, ſtrake at the Giant, which he auoyding, the blow diſcended to the ground: and the Prince not beeing able to recouer his might, béeing ſo farre ſpent, fell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the ground alſo in a traunce. Which the Giant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, and (contrary to his nature) pittying his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, conſidering the great vallour which he had ſéene in him, went and pulled off his Helme to giue him ayre, and taking him vppe in his armes, carried him into the Caſtle, where he was layd on a good bedde, and his wounds care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked vnto. For Syr <hi>Peſtrill,</hi> who vnder the Duke his Coſin was Commaunder of the Caſtle, was a very vertuous Knight, and one who greatly pittied the Princes captiuity: conſidering what greefe would thereby riſe, both to the King, and all the Nobilitie of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> He alſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the body of the Giant <hi>Brandofell</hi> to be brought in and cured: whoſe wounds though they were many and great, yet were there none of them mortall. The Damſell ſéeing things ſort according to her minde, departed away highly contented.</p>
               <p>Now returne we to the Princes Squyre, who hauing
<pb facs="tcp:150602:70"/> beheld this vnhappy ouer-throw of his Maiſter, together with his impriſonment, not knowing whether hee were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or dead, fared like a man out of his wits, and ran ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp and downe the Forreſt, crying and exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fortune, and the deſtinies which had permitted ſuch great inuiſtice: and at length, the morning being come, hée determined to returne vnto the Citty of <hi>Parris,</hi> where the next day he arriued, and comming vnto the King, before him and all the nobles of the Court, hee recounted his Maſters miſaduenture, together with all that hapned in the battaile with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Giants: which bred ſuch a griefe and amazedneſſe in all the hearers, as well you may iudge if the like euent ſhould hapen. Euery one determining to hazard their liues, or to ſet him frée if he liued, all conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to be an inchauntment, knowing that in that place, there was neuer any Caſtle heard of. But when this newes came to the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> you may well thinke her griefe was not ſmal, for falling preſently into a traunce, her Damſells had much to doe to recouer life in her againe: and being in the end recouered, burſting foorth into bitter exclamations, both againſt the heauens and powers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thus continued ſhee all that night, ſounding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding in the armes of her Ladies and Gentlewomen: the King her father, and the Quéene vſing all the meanes they could, by perſwaſions to comfort her. Héere will wée for a while leaue them in this generall lamentation, for the loſſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince, euery one making prouiſion to goe try the ſame aduenture: and will returne to ſpeake, of the Prince <hi>Iago</hi> of <hi>Saxonie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may remember how diſcontented the <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince tooke the departure of his ſuppoſed brother, the Gentleman of the Forreſt: who hauing ſéene him aboord, &amp; being againe returned vnto the Court, beganne to waxe ſo melancholy, that hee ſéemed to take delight in nothing, although the Duke his father perceauing it, and for remedy for the ſame, deuiſed all the meanes he could to worke his content, as by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Iuſts and turnaments, wherein he héeretofore was wont to receaue great content, and other times hunting of the wilde Boare, and ſuch other exerciſes, ſtill fearing his departure.</p>
               <p>But neither this, nor yet the delightfull company of the Princeſſe his ſiſter, whom he intirely loued, could in any ſort worke him that content, which he was wont to receaue in the company of the Gentleman of the Forreſt: whoſe want, together with the deſire of following ſtrange aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein he hoped to atchieue immortall renowne, by his valiant and heroick déedes, which hee doubted not but ſo performe, increaſed in him ſuch an ardent deſire to trauell. Whereof many times being denaied by the Duke his Father, at length hauing reſolued with himſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, he called vnto him one of his Squires whom hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loued, and on whoſe ſecreſie and good ſeruice, hee more depended then on any other, and declaring vnto him his determination, willed him to prouide for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſhould bee with all the ſecreſie that might bée. His Squire, hauing vnderſtoode his Maiſters reſolution, departed to prouide for the ſame, and comming to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, found a ſhip ready bound for <hi>England:</hi> and agréeing
<pb facs="tcp:150602:71"/> with the maiſter thereof for their paſſage, the next night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed aboord both horſe and armor, and ſuch other things as ſhould bee requiſite for their iourny: and hauing infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Prince héereof, the next day, the Prince being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only with his Squire, as many times he was accuſtomed, departed from the Pallace, not ſuſpected of any one, hauing left in his chamber window, a letter written to his father, declaring therein the cauſe of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus walking a foote, they arriued towards euening at the port where the ſhippe ancored, and comming aboord, hauing the winde faire, they ſet ſaile, directing their courſe for <hi>Douer,</hi> of which harbor the ſhippe was. Thus beeing at Sea, and hauing the winde and weather faire, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince betooke himſelfe to ſléepe, being with cares ouerwatched, for in thrée nights before he had not ſlept, ſo earneſt was his minde bent on this his iourny: and now being as hée thought in ſecurity from being ſtopped of his purpoſe, hée ſlept ſoundly, till it was towards the morning, when hée thought there appeared before his ſight, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beautifulleſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that euer he beheld: who comming vnto him, caſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his armes, deſiring his protection againſt a fierce and vgly Giant, who purſued her. The Prince héerewith awaking, beganne to ponder with himſelfe, concerning his dreame, muſing what it might ſignifie, but the beauty and comly grace of the Lady, ſtucke ſo faſt in his memory, that by no meanes he could put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame out of his minde: which cauſed him in the end, to conclude, that it muſt néedes bée ſome Lady, whom the deſtinies had ordained him to loue, determined to yéeld himſelfe priſoner, before the aſſault ſhould grow too hote: thus continued this amerous young Prince, intangled in her beauty whom he neuer had ſéene, minding to reſt in no place, vntill ſuch time as he had found her out, whom in his dreame he beheld. By this time had they continued at Sea by the ſpace of eight daies, not mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with any aduenture worth the memory, hauing the winde faire, and the Seas ſo calme as might bée, till on the ninth day comming almoſt on ſhore on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caoſt of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:150602:71"/> they perceaued a ſhippe with ſailes and ores, as much as they could to make towards them: which the Maiſter and the reſt of the Saylers, preſently knewe to be a Pyrat, and calling the Prince vnto them, to knowe what counſell hée would giue in this extremitie, they all beeing minded to yéeld, rather then to fight, conſidering the vnequalneſſe of the match, and the cruelty the Pyrats commonly vſed to thoſe, who made reſiſtance. But the Prince not minding to ſubmit himſelfe into the hands of ſuch villaines, gaue them counſell not to yéeld, but to fight it out to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt man, and calling for his Armor, immediatly armed himſelfe: ſwearing them all to performe their beſt indeuours, for to defend themſelues.</p>
               <p>By this time was the Pirate come vp with them, and warning them to yéelde vnto his mercie, the Prince ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloft vppon the decke, with his ſword drawne in his hand, &amp; his ſhield vpon his arme, replied, that they meant to defend themſelues, as not béeing accuſtomed with wordes to be daunted. The Pirat <hi>Geroll</hi> hearing this aunſwere, commaunded to grapple with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhyp. The prince at the firſt incountring with a great lubber, who proffered to leape aboord their ſhyp, gaue him ſo ſound a blow on the ſconte, that it cauſed him out of the ſhrowdes to tumble headlong into the Sea, and after him another, and another: ſo that in the part of the ſhip where hée was, the fight began to grow excéeding hote, many of the Pirats ſouldiers bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten aboord, but by the helpe of his Squire, and the Maiſters mate, who was a luſtie fellow, they quickly clée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theyr ſhippe againe, and the Prince hauing receiued a wound by one of the Pyrats, who was aboord theyr owne ſhyp, not knowing which way to be reuenged, leapt foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with into theyr ſhyp, &amp; béeing inraged, laid on ſuch blowes, that euery one thought himſelfe happieſt when they were fartheſt from him: for by this time there were ſlaine aboue twenty of the Pirats. Which <hi>Geroll</hi> perceiuing, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well that if the Knight were ſlaine, he ſhould eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquiſh the reſt: and hoping to performe it with his
<pb facs="tcp:150602:72"/> owne hands, he came ſtealing behind him, but the Prince who was ordained to finiſh greater matters, perceiuing his intent, turned his face towards him, giuing him ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation with his ſword, that it cauſed him to bend with one of his knées euen to the deck.</p>
               <p>Now began betwéene them two a moſt cruell Combat, the Pyrat béeing a ſtrong and luſtie fellow, &amp; one that had foughten many dangerous battels, and alſo béeing ayded by thoſe of his partie, aſſaulted the Prince with great fury, and were as gallantly by him reſiſted, to theyr no ſmal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice: for within leſſe then halfe an howre, hee had ſlaine ſixe of them, wounding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt very grieuouſly. And by this time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, hauing tackt about, came to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue of the Prince, which ſo diſmayed the Pyrats, that bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but tenne of them left aliue, and they for the moſt part hurt, as before-ſaid, determined to intreate for mercy, and falling downe vpon theyr knées, beſought the Prince with one voyce to ſaue theyr liues: which he eaſily yéelded vnto.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Prince <hi>Iago,</hi> hauing taken his leaue of the Gouernour of <hi>Douer,</hi> tooke his way directly towards <hi>London,</hi> accompanied onely with his Squire, vnto whom for the more pleaſant paſſing of the time, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his dreame, in a viſion which hée had ſéene at his comming out of <hi>Saxony.</hi> Thus paſt they away theyr weariſome iourney, till on the fourth day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming within fiue miles of the Citty, they heard one moſt pittifully wéeping: and drawing ſomewhat néere the ſame, there béeing a high banke betwéene them and the voyce which they heard, they ſtayed awhile to vnderſtand the cauſe of that lamentation. When ſuddenly they might heare the wéeping ceaſe, and the party to fetch a déepe and grieuous ſigh, ſaying: Is it poſſible, that God will alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forſake the diſtreſſed innocent, and ſuffer ſuch great iniuſtice, not rayſing vp any one to helpe or ſuccour theyr rightfull cauſe againſt ſo euident a treaſon: O y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would pleaſe him to raiſe vp another <hi>Daniell,</hi> to find out theyr ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed forgeries, and to frée this his diſtreſſed <hi>Suſanna,</hi> or that it would pleaſe his almighty power, to indue mée with ſtrength and courage, whereby I might force them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe theyr moſt wrongfull and falſe accuſation, againſt the moſt vertuous Lady liuing: but alas, I ſée mine own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:73"/> béeing a weake and féeble woman, too too far vnable to accompliſh the ſame, and the eares of the Almighty ſo ſtopt againſt my prayers, that he dooth not heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But what doo I meane, ſo much to blaſpheme his holy Name, as to ſay hée dooth not heare, when alas it is our ſinnes which cauſeth him not to grant what we require: or peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he may deferre the ſame, to the greater ſetting forth of his glory: that when all hope is paſt, euen then hee may ſhew his omnipotent power by ſome ſtrange deliuerance. Héere againe ſhe pauſed.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iago</hi> mounting vp the banke, perceiued that ſhee was a comely young Gentlewoman, whom hee ſaluted, and béeing by her againe reſaluted, he demaunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of her griefe, which by her complaint he imagined to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great: aſſuring her withall, that if the matter were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent vnto truth, and to be tryed by dint of ſword, ſhe had met with one, who would willingly hazard his life in defence of the innocent. The Damſell hearing his kind proffer, and withall, viewing the comly proportion of his body, began ſomewhat to comfort herſelfe, hoping y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God had ſent him of purpoſe, to defend the iuſt cauſe of her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Lady, anſwered him. Moſt curteous and valiant Knight, for ſo much my mind dooth aſſure you to be, I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you infinite thanks for this your kind &amp; willing offer, hoping by the time you haue heard my wofull narration, you will be throughly aſſured of the equity of the cauſe, which hath mooued in me, &amp; many more this ſorrow, which euen now you found in me, and the vniuſt and trecherous dealing, of the moſt diſloialleſt Knight that liues. Knowe then, that whilſt this Court of <hi>England</hi> enioyed their moſt vallerous Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> who now by the ſpace of eyghtéene yeres hath continued impriſoned in an inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Caſtle in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> did floriſh with many braue and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Knights, amongſt whom there was a noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, called the Lord <hi>Mowbray,</hi> a man for his vertue and vallor greatly eſtéemed of all, but eſpecially beloued by the Prince, with whom hee went into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where by his
<pb facs="tcp:150602:73"/> vallor he wonne immortal fame: and after the loſſe of the Prince, hazarding himſelfe for his deliuerance, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there taken priſoner. This Lord left behind him at his departure, a ſonne and a daughter, his ſonne beeing of the age of ſeauen yéeres, and his daughter called <hi>Beleriza,</hi> of the age of fiue yéeres, both vnder the cuſtody of theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and noble Mother: who hauing brought them vp in vertuous and godly liuing, vntill they were of ripe yéeres, departed this world, leauing both her children vnto theyr owne gouernments: <hi>Beleriza</hi> had béene of long time belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; ſued vnto, by a gallant young Knight, named <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco,</hi> whom ſhée likewiſe intirely loued, yet minding to prooue his loyaltie, intreated him to goe into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to combat with the two Giants, <hi>Brandofell</hi> and <hi>Furioll,</hi> who kept the Inchaunted Caſtle, where the Prince and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with diuers other famous Knights were impriſoned. <hi>Franciſco</hi> willing to haue ſo fit occaſion, both to pleaſure his Lady and Miſtriſſe, and alſo to ſhowe foorth his vallor, which he thought euen vnmatchable, preſently conſented, promiſing to worke wounders, and ſo fitting himſelfe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted towards <hi>Fraunce.</hi> But before his taking ſhippe hée wrote vnto his Lady, as néere as I can geſſe, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing verſes.</p>

               <p>Hauing written theſe verſes vnto his Lady, he departed, what ſithence hath hapned vnto him I doe not know, but imagine he hath ſped as ill as thoſe, who héeretofore haue made triall of the ſame aduenture. Now being departed, there was another gallant, which likewiſe fell in liking with my Lady <hi>Beleriza,</hi> one whom indéede the inheritance of my Lord their father, if they both hapned to die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue, of right did appertaine. This gallant called <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Roberto,</hi> imagining that my Lord their father, and his kinſman was either deade, or neuer to be deliuered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed which way to aſſure himſelfe of his poſſeſſions: and thinking if hee could deuiſe how to obtaine my Lady to bée his wife, the matter were in a manner aſſured, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that her brother, whoſe name was likewiſe called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto,</hi> being a man of a valient and hauty minde, would hazard himſelfe in the aduenture of the Inchaunted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, wherein he did not doubt, but that he would be eyther ſlaine, or taken priſoner, and then of right it ſhould apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto him. And béeing reſolued héereon, hee vſed all
<pb facs="tcp:150602:74"/> the meanes he could to obtaine her liking. But ſhe hauing ſetled her affection, as is before ſayd, on <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> made ſmall or no account him: which he perceauing, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all his fained loue into hatred, deuiſing which way to bring to paſſe by trechery, that which he could not hope for by the loue of my Lady, which in the end he thus brought to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Hauing many times animated his Coſin <hi>Don Roberto,</hi> to hazard himſelfe for the deliuery of my Lord his father, which the young Gentleman himſelfe, had a great deſire vnto, and now hauing taken the order of Knighthoode, and made preparation for his iourny into <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and being accompanied the Sea-ſide, through which he muſt néedes paſſe, was at vnwares ſet on by a cupple of villaines, and before he could drawe his ſword, was by them ſlaine: his Squire flying away, with in leſſe then a mile, met with this graund homicide, his Maiſters kinſman, vnto whom he recounted the murder of his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Roberto</hi> hearing this, making as if he had grieued thereat mightily, raiſing the Country to apprehend thoſe murtherers, the one of them taking a Riuer, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eſcape, was drowned therein: the other being taken, was knowne to bee a ſeruant to the traytor <hi>Don Roberto,</hi> who comming where he was, after he had priuatly talked with him, and inſtructed him what he ſhould ſay, examined him openly, where the villaine moſt falſely auouched, that they were hired to commit this murder, by my Lady <hi>Beleriza,</hi> which hee no ſooner had confeſſed, but <hi>Don Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto,</hi> fearing leaſt the feare of death ſhould make him in the end to confeſſe the truth, with his ponyard ſuddenly ſtabbed him to the hart. Then poſting to the Court, hée cauſed my Lady to be apprehended, accuſing her before the King of the murder of her brother, which alas, was more grieuious vnto her, then the ſentence of her owne death, which preſently by the King was pronounced againſt her: if that within twelue months ſhee were not prouided of a
<pb facs="tcp:150602:75"/> Knight, who in combat with <hi>Don Roberto,</hi> ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her innocencie. And now there is not paſſing tenne daies to come of the prefixed time, ſhee good Lady not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any one, who will hazard himſelfe for her deliuerance, although ſhe is greatly pittied of euery one: yet ſo much is the number of good and hardy Knights in this Kingdome abated, by the occaſion of the Princes loſſe, that there is ſcarce any one thought able to matche the traytor in ſingle fight. Loe héere moſt noble Knight, haue I as néere as I can, declared vnto you the truth: hoping that God will ſo guide your minde, as to vndertake the defence, of the moſt vertuous and ſorrowfull <hi>Beleriza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Iago,</hi> hauing attentiuely liſtned vnto her whole diſcourſe, by which he aſſured himſelfe of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of the Lady, bad her recomfort herſelfe, for if at his arriuall at the Court, by inquiry hee ſhould finde the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be as ſhe had declared, hee would, if <hi>Beleriza</hi> would accept of him as her Champion, hazard his body for her defence, not doubting but to make her accuſer confeſſe his treaſon againſt her. Thus taking the Damſell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, they rode towards the Citty, where they arriued a little before night: The next day hauing reſted himſelfe, and viewed the ſtatelineſſe of the Citty, which to him ſéemed the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt that euer he beheld, hee did what he might to inquire, the truth of the Ladies impriſonment: where by diuers he was informed in the ſame, euen as the Damſell had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him. Thus hauing ſtayed ſome foure or fiue daies in the Citty, being continually viſited by the Damſell, and now being throughly reſolued of the innocencie of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was deſirous to ſée her, &amp; to know whether ſhe would accept of him as her Champion. And being by the Damſell conuaied vnto the place where ſhee remained impriſoned, he was by her moſt kindly welcomed, giuing him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thankes for his proffered kindneſſe, by her not any waies deſerued, and admitting him for her Champion, ſhe ſayd. Noble Knight, I heere fréely deliuer vnto you, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence both of my life and honor, deſiring God no other way
<pb facs="tcp:150602:75"/> to ſpéede you, then according to the truth and equitie of my cauſe, which he knowes beſt: aſſuring you farther, that the death of my brother for which I am accuſed, is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious vnto me, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any torment I can indure. It is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, euery vertuous wight, regardeth more y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of their friends, then of themſelues, and I belieue the ſame of you: wherefore I doe not doubt, but to your eternall fame, I ſhall make manifeſt your innocencie. Thus depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he away, making preparation againſt the battaile: what happened therein, you ſhall reade in the Chapter following.</p>

The King with diuers of his Nobles, being already placed on their ſcaffold to behold the battaile: the priſoner was brought fourth attired all in blacke, hauing a farre white Laune caſt ouer hee head, being accompanied with many beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladies of the Court, attired alſo in mourning appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, bewailing her miſfortune: thus was ſhee conducted vnto a ſcaffold appointed for her, after her came the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, mounted on a ſtately bay courſer, all in tauny armor, as ſorrowing for the death of his kinſman. And comming before the King, bending himſelfe in his Saddle, as doing obedience to his Maieſtie, ſpake as followeth. Moſt dread Soueraigne, I humbly beſéech you to cauſe that deteſtable murtherer, either preſently to bring foorth her Champion, if ſhe be of any one prouided, whom I may foorthwith, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifeſtation of her crime ouercome, or if ſhe be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that then according to the lawe ſhee be foorthwith executed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150602:76"/>
               <p>The King diſliking this is preſumption, as alſo greatly affecting <hi>Beleriza,</hi> for her fathers ſake, ſayd. <hi>Signior Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> I know not whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priſoner be prepared of a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion or no, but your preſumptious boldneſſe, in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to teach mee what I haue to doe, cauſeth me thinke that your great pride will ſoone take a fall, for you might well haue ſtayed your haſt, vntill I had cauſed the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, according to the vſe of Armes, to ſummon the deffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: and then if he had not come foorth at the third ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, you might boldly haue demaunded iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Then ſtaying a while, the trumpets were willed to ſound to warne the defendant, who foorthwith being mounted on a milke white Stéede, his Armor all gréene, beſet with Couſlips of gold, and bearing in his ſhield in an Azure field a beautifull Lady, with his word in letters of gold, <hi>Vbi neſcio:</hi> repreſenting thereby, the Lady whom he ſawe in his dreame. In this manner entred hee the Liſts, and trotting with a comly ſoft pace towards the King, with his Beauer lifted vp, to whom he did reuerence, demaunding which was the Knight, who had ſo falſely accuſed the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Lady. The King beholding his comly grace, and perceauing by his ſpéech that he was a ſtranger, moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, ſhowed him <hi>Signior Roberto:</hi> vnto whom <hi>Iago</hi> ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, I doe not a little meruaile, how you béeing a man honorably diſcended, could harbor ſo baſe and vild a thought, as to accuſe this Lady your kinſwoman, of a murder wherein your ſelfe ſéemeth to be an Actor, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you would not ſo ſuddenly haue killed that wicked homicide your ſeruant, but haue ſuffred him to haue liued, and openly to haue confeſſed that, which you in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did greatly feare hee would denie: but I doubt not but God, by my arme, will manifeſt that, which by his death you did hope to haue concealed. <hi>Roberto</hi> rayſing him ſelfe in his ſtirrups, and raging to be ſo touched with the truth, and truſting in his owne might and force, replyed in this manner.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150602:76"/>
               <p>Foole-hardy Knight, thou ſhalt ſoone know what thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath gained, by béeing allured with her lookes to hazard thy life in a cauſe ſo vniuſt as this is which thou dooſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and how farre thy falſe and opprobrious ſpéeches hath incenſed my choller againſt thée, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as recreant thou ſhalt aſke mercy, in ſtéed thereof thou ſhalt receiue cruell death.

Thus béeing by the Iudges placed in the liſts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wind and ſunne equally diſtributed vnto them, they ſet ſpurres to their horſes, &amp; placing theyr Launces in theyr reſts, they met together with ſuch fury, that breaking their ſtaues to theyr hands, <hi>Roberto</hi> was throwne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horſe, and the Prince hauing likewiſe loſt one of his ſtirrups, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on without any great ſemblance of moouing: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the end of his courſe, turning about his horſe, hee ſaw <hi>Signior Roberto</hi> addreſſing himſelfe for the foote com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: which he no ſooner perceiued, but alighting from his horſe, &amp; drawing foorth his ſword, went to méet him, where betwéene them began a moſt cruell and doubtfull combat, no man knowing to which party victory was like to inſue, <hi>Don Roberto</hi> béeing a very ſtrong and mightie Knight, layd on blowes amaine, as truſting in his great ſtrength, which ſurely was much, and had hee beene indued as well with vertue as vallour, he might well haue béene eſtéemed for one of the beſt Knights in <hi>England.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:150602:77"/> béeing not altogether of the beſt, though gallant to the eye, was broken the ſooner with his huge blowes: although on the contrary ſide, <hi>Roberto</hi> had receiued more great &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wounds, through the thruſts which the Prince had made. And now béeing both breathleſſe, they reſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues awhile, viewing each other, and ſtudying which way moſt how to indammage his aduerſary. At length, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well reſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, they fell to theyr combat afreſh, the Prince <hi>Iago</hi> ſéeming more luſtie and quicke then at the beginning, began now to follow his aduerſary with many mighty blowes and ſharpe thruſts, cauſing him in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nothing but to defend himſelfe: and imagining indéed that he was not long able to continue, very vnaduiſedly purſued him with blowes and thruſts, not hauing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to defend himſelfe, but to offend his foe. Which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto</hi> perceiuing, gaue him ſo cruell a blow on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſide, that pearcing his Armor, which was not of ſufficient force to defend the might of his arme, wounded him to the bone: which the Prince féeling, and conſidering that it came by his raſh careleſneſſe, determined to haue a greater regard to himſelfe: &amp; following his fortune with good aduiſement, gaue <hi>Don Roberto</hi> to vnderſtand, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow was to him a good ſchoole point, ſo that at length hauing driuen him from place to place, béeing no longer able to withſtand his force, hauing loſt great abundance of blood, hee fell on his knees, deſiring him to ſaue his life, and he would confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole truth.</p>
               <p>The Prince héereunto ſoone granted, and bringing him before the King, <hi>Roberto</hi> confeſſed, firſt how he had deuiſed to come vnto the inhearitance of the Lord <hi>Mowbray</hi> his kinſman, by marrying with his daughter, and afterwards béeing by her refuſed, how he had deuiſed this meanes, as in the former Chapter is declared. Which when the King with the reſt of the Lords there preſent had heard, they did not a little meruaile hereat: and preſently cauſing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Beleriza</hi> to be fet, and greatly honoured, extolling the ſtrange Knight highly, the King demaunded of <hi>Beleriza</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:150602:77"/> whence and what he was: to which ſhe aunſwered that ſhe knew not. Then the King demaunded of himſelfe of what Country he was. And he very curteouſly aunſwered him, that he was borne in the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and hauing giuen his mind to trauell, was commonly called the Knight of Fortune: and now hapning to arriue to this Country, and comming to view this Court, the ſtatelines whereof he had many times before heard of, was by chance giuen to vnderſtand, the wrong which was doone vnto <hi>Beleriza</hi> by her Coſin <hi>Don Roberto,</hi> and conſidering that it is the part of all Knights to defend the innocent, eſpecially Ladies and Gentlewomen, who are not able to defend themſelues, I vndertooke the ſame, which by the aſſiſtance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I haue accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>The King hearing this his ſpéech, which he vttered with a moſt comly grace, greatly commended him in his hart: and giuing charge vnto his Surgions for the curing of his wounds, wherof he had great néede, he determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede in iudgement againſt <hi>Signior Roberto.</hi> But hee by this time, through the many grieuous and mortal wounds which he had receiued, had giuen vp the ghoſt: whereby he preuented the King of inflicting the puniſhment which hee worthily deſerued, and which aſſuredly, if he had liued, hée ſhold haue ſuffered. But now ſéeing he was already dead, the King commaunded him to be buried in the ſame place where the battel was fought, cauſing him to be layd for the honour of the Houſe, from whence hee was diſcended, in a Tombe of Marble, very curiouſly wrought, with this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaph written thereon.</p>

               <p>The next day, no ſooner had beautifull <hi>Aurora,</hi> rowling herſelfe out of old <hi>Nox</hi> his couch, ſtept foorth into the viewe of this world, being raide in her wonted garments of gray, and as it were halfe bluſhing to haue remained ſo long, in the loutiſh armes of her late old bed-fellowe, went to welcome her new Bridge-grome the ſonne, but our two noble Knights being mounted on their ſtately Stéeds, and armed at all points, entred the Liſts: ſcarce dayning one to ſpeake to the other. And now hauing fetcht their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, met together with ſuch force, that their Launces were broken into a thouſand ſhiuers, the ſplinters thereof flying into the aire, themſelues both paſſing on without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moouing in their Saddles: and hauing ended their courſe, and turning about their horſes, <hi>Adreſto</hi> intreated the Knight of the Lions, to breake a ſtaffe or two more, vntill ſuch time as one of them were diſmounted, to which he willingly agreed: and at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commaundement of <hi>Adreſto,</hi> there was a bundle of Launces brought, the Knight being willed to chuſe firſt.</p>
               <p>Then running againe, they incountred with ſuch force, that <hi>Adreſto</hi> looſing both his ſtirrups, was likewiſe forced to take hold by his horſe mane, the other béeing in the ſame ſort driuen to take hold, hauing loſt his right ſtirrup, &amp; ſhe

On the otherſide, the Knight of the Lyons calling to his minde his beloued Lady the Princeſſe <hi>Egiſena,</hi> ſaid: Déere La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſée héere thy féeble Knight, as it were mated by this falſe <hi>Adreſto,</hi> nay, onely the feare of your diſlike, is the cauſe that he hath béene able to indure againſt me: but I beſéech you call to minde your former kindneſſes, and confirme the ſame with your conſtant aſſurance, and then I doubt not but to be well able to vanquiſh this Knight, whom for his vallor I cannot chuſe but loue.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpéeches on both ſides were ſcarce ended, when méeting together, they brake theyr ſtaues hard home to theyr Gauntlets, and méeting with theyr bodies, they ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed together in ſuch ſort, that theyr horſes had much to doo to ſtand vnder them, but were forced to ramble backwards, but at length, hauing recouered themſelues, the Knights béeing both wearied with theyr rough incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more to Iuſt, drew foorth theyr ſwords, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themſelues to the Combat, the Knight of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was the firſt that aſſayled his aduerſary: and tutching his horſe with his left ſpurre, came cloſe with <hi>Adreſto,</hi> deliuering him ſuch a blow on the ſhield, that ſlyeing away a great part thereof, wounded him a little on the left thygh: which <hi>Don Adreſto,</hi> ſoone requited, for comming in with his left ſide, and making as if he would haue giuen a thruſt at his body, ſuddenly by the agillity and quickneſſe of his
<pb facs="tcp:150602:80"/> horſe, he was on the other ſide of him, and deliuered a full blowe at his head, taking him ſo ſound a knocke, that had it not béene for the goodneſſe of his Armor, he had then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the battaile: but the Armor beeing of approoued good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſaued his Maiſter from any hurt, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weight thereof did halfe a ſtony him, but comming ſoone to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, &amp; raiſing himſelfe in his ſtirrupps, he gaue <hi>Adreſto</hi> a mighty blowe, which had he not warded with his ſhield, had aſſuredly claue him to the téeth, for notwithſtanding, the goodneſſe of the ſhield, which was of pure &amp; well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered ſteele: he claue it in the midſt, and entring through both Helme and coyfe, wounded him in the head, to the great aſtoniſhment of his ſences. Thus continued they a great while with equall odds, not one knowing which had the a vantage: for although <hi>Adreſto</hi> had receaued many wounds, yet the vertue of the King which he weare on his finger was ſuch, that he loſt not one droppe of blood: Thus hauing continued by the ſpace of two houres, at laſt the Knight of the Lions, hauing giuen him a mighty blowe on the head, which cauſed him as one in a traunce to réele on his horſe, and before ſuch time as he could recouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hauing deliuered another blowe betwéene his head &amp; ſhoulders, cauſed him to fall from his horſe in a traunce, which the Knight of the Lions perceauing, immediatly diſmounted, thinking to haue taken off his Helme, and to haue giuen him ayre, but before hee could come vnto him, <hi>Adreſto</hi> had recouered his féete, and taking vp his ſword, which hung by a ſmall chayne faſtned vnto his arme, ſayd: Knight of the Lyons, I had thought before this time there had not béen any Knight able to match mee on horſebacke, but now I find my ſelfe deceiued: wherfore I ſuppoſe thou maiſt thanke thine Armorer, which hath ſo well fitted thée, but I doubt not now beeing on foote, to deale with you ſome what better. It is well ſayd, anſwered the other, and were not my cauſe more iuſt then thine, I ſhould greatly feare mee of the victory: but conſidering the wrong which thou dooſt vnto that vertuous Lady <hi>Lenarda,</hi> it cauſeth mee to
<pb facs="tcp:150602:80"/> hope the beſt: wherefore once more let me intreate thée to conſent to returne vnto her. Nay, aunſwered <hi>Adreſto,</hi> I both defie thy intreates, and her loue, and therefore defend thy ſelfe. Then againe hurred they together more fiercely then at the firſt, but not with like aduantage, for <hi>Adreſto</hi> before was greatly ayded by the quicknes of his horſe: and now béeing on foote, although he were very quick and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the paine which he ſuſtained by his wounds were a great hinderance vnto him. On the contrary ſide, the Knight of the Lyons, béeing before on the backe of a horſe daily vſed to trauell, was not altogether of the quickeſt, but now béeing on foote, and in his chiefe prime, not hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any wound, was farre more quick then his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by which meanes he both ſaued himſelfe, and hurt his enemy euen at pleaſure. And at length, taking <hi>Adreſto</hi> at aduantage, gaue him a ſound blow on the ſide of the head, which cauſed him ſo ramble, and before hee could recouer himſelfe, gaue him one or two more, ſo that hee was forced in a traunce to fall to the earth: which the Knight percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſtept vnto him, and before hee would giue him ayre, tooke of his gauntlet, and then finding the ring, tooke it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his finger: and vnlacing his Helme, he ſoone brought him to himſelfe, and perceiuing him to offer to riſe, ſaid, <hi>Adre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto</hi> yéeld thy ſelfe, and promiſe to forſake this wicked kinde of life, and to goe into <hi>Spayne</hi> to the Dutches <hi>Lenarda,</hi> or elſe thou dieſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adreſto</hi> béeing throughly come to himſelfe, and hearing the name of <hi>Lenardo,</hi> began to call to mind his former loue towards her, and in a manner cleane forgetting the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants daughter, ſaid. Moſt noble Knight, I doo not onely yéeld my ſelfe vnto your mercy, but alſo willingly will doe as you commaund me, where I will yéeld mee to the noble Dutches mercy: whom I muſt néedes confeſſe, greatly to haue wronged. The Knight of the Lyons immediatly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him vp from the ground, imbraſt him in his armes, ſaying: that if he did as he had promiſed, he ſhould do right well, and in ſo dooing, hee ſhould find him for euer an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:150602:81"/> friend. For which <hi>Adreſto</hi> gaue him infinite thankes, vowing to him the like.</p>
               <p>Now by this time was the Lady <hi>Lenardas</hi> Squire come vnto them, and ſaluting <hi>Adreſto,</hi> demaunded how he did, <hi>Adreſto</hi> beholding him, immediatly knewe him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him in his armes, demanded how his Lady fared, to whom the Squire declared, the great ſorrow wherin ſhe had remained euer ſince his departure. And now hauing bound vp the wounds which he had receiued in the combat as well as they could, (for as ſoone as the King was taken from his finger, his wounds fell on bléeding) they returned into the Cittie, where they remained by the ſpace of three wéekes, for the curing of his wounds, and prouiding all things neceſſary for their departure. Then taking leaue of the fayre Damſell whom he left with child, and the reſt of his acquaintance, they departed towards the Citty of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi> where they were in hope to finde the ſhip in which the Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyons had there arriued, leauing all <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> ſorry for his departure.</p>

               <p>There was vnder one of the fayreſt Chambers in the Caſtle, a darke and déepe vaute, hauing no way into the ſame but by a trappe-doore out of the fore-ſaid Chamber, ouer which he cauſed a bed to be made for the Knight, and hauing placed two or thrée villaines in the vaute, with charge to murder him, cauſed in ſtéed of ropes, nothing but ſmall ſticks to be layd vnder the bed, which might ſuſtaine the weight thereof: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Knight once laying him downe theron, muſt of force tumble headlong into the vaut, where the villaines béeing ready to receiue him, ſhould ſoone haue ended his life: had not GOD otherwiſe prouided for his ſafety, and appointed him to a farther ſetting foorth of his glory, and thus it was. His ſeruant <hi>Gillimo,</hi> whoſe life he ſaued, when as he ſlew the reſt of his company, the night before hee reſcued <hi>Molenda,</hi> and of a thiefe entertained him to be his ſeruaunt: hée I ſay, contrary to the common vſe of ſuch fellowes, who according to the old ſaying, (Saue a thiefe from the gallowes, and he will be the firſt that will cut thy throte) hauing an eſpeciall loue and care vnto his Maiſter, as thinking that time ill ſpent, which was not to his profit or content, &amp; that in dooing the ſame hee did God good ſeruice, was alwayes very carefull and diligent about him, eſpecially, where hee did any way ſuſpect euill to be meant towards him: but now more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at any other time,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:82"/> knowing the wickednes of <hi>Mack Gillum,</hi> hee liſtned and prided about, to ſée if hee could perceaue them whiſper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues.

               <p>Now <hi>Mack Gillum</hi> hauing called for lights, willed his wife and two of his daughters, to accompany <hi>Adreſto</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chamber, and hee himſelfe would accompany the Knight of the Lions vnto his (where hee hoped ere long to be ſufficiently reuenged, for the wrong which hee had done vnto his Coſin.)

               <p>The Knight of the Lions, &amp; the reſt of them that were in the chamber, at the firſt were greatly aſtonied héereat: but ſéeing the ſequell, and conſidering that it was deuiſed
<pb facs="tcp:150602:82"/> of purpoſe for to haue murdered him, fell on their knées, and gaue thankes vnto almighty God, who had deliuered him, out of this iminent danger of death.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may remember how in the former part of this Hiſtory, that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Maiance,</hi> the Count <hi>Hermes,</hi> and others of the chiefe ſtates of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> diſliking the gouernment, whereof themſelues were in a manner the chiefe and firſt beginners, had practiſed with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King, for the ſending ouer forces, promiſing to deliuer the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke</hi> into his hands, and farther, to that end had deliuered pledges for ſure perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof.</p>
               <p>Now therefore the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> hauing muſtred vp his forces, made choiſe of tenne thouſand of his approoued and beſt men of Armes, and hauing fitted them of all things néedfull for that warre, gaue them in charge vnto his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Earle of <hi>Douglaſſe:</hi> a man for his vallour and courage highly to bee commended, and for his wiſdome and pollicie, to bee compared with moſt in Chriſtendome: as hauing great experience, eſpecially in matters of affaires, wherein he had ſpent the greateſt part of his time, being now about the age of forty eight or fifty yeares: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him did the King deliuer this Armie, with frée commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſpoſe thereof, &amp; of the whole affaires of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> With this Armie he departed towards the Sea-coaſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many braue and hardy Knights who vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentary went to beare him company, with hope in theſe warres to gaine ſame by their vallour: and being come to the towne of <hi>Helfue,</hi> they tooke ſhipping, and the winde ſeruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they directed their courſe towards <hi>Denmarke,</hi> hauing before hand ſent intelligence of their comming, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the traytors to their Country, their confedrats, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

Of which ſort there were a great many, who for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cauſes were ſoone drawne into the ſame, eſpecially ſuch as by any meanes had offended the lawes, and feared the penaltie thereof: which by the Gouernors was ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed.</p>
               <p>Who now vpon this rumor and hurliburly, were not a little troubled, and perceauing ſuch great men to be actors héerein, feared a generall reuolt, wherefore drawing themſelues together into counſell, they deuiſed all the meanes they could, to preuent the ſame: and hauing ſent vnto the Arch Biſhop and his complices, by faire meanes to haue cauſed them to lay downe their weapons, and not like madmen as it were to rip their owne bowels, which they muſt néedes doe in ſtirring vp this ciuill contention, which is the greateſt enemie that poſſible may happen to any common-wealth, and that in calling in forren powers, was not only to bring into bondage their Country, and natiue ſoyle, but alſo themſelues and their whole poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for what Conquerer is there, that hauing brought into ſubiection any Kingdome or Prouince, will not cauſe his owne lawes &amp; cuſtomes to be imbraced by the vanquiſhed, which he cannot well doe, except firſt he not only roote out thoſe, whom he thinkes may be any way a hindrance vnto his procéedings, then likewiſe muſt hee place as Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Rulers ouer his people, ſuch as he ſhall thinke readieſt to obey and fulfill his commaundements, which can be no other but of his owne natiue Country: and then how grieuous it will bee vnto you to be commaunded by ſtrangers, doe but conſider.

And now hauing prouided all ſuch things as he had néed of, and agréeing with the Maiſter of the ſhip for his paſſage, he went aboord, and hauing the wind fayre, they ſet to Sea in ſo happy a time, that within ſixe dayes, they arriued at a Port called <hi>Old-bay,</hi> where going on ſhore, they directed theyr courſe towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citty of <hi>Nanſe,</hi> where, he ſtaying awhile to reſt himſelfe, he vnderſtood that the Quéene, with a great trayne of Lords &amp; Ladies, were lately arriued at the Citty of <hi>Towels,</hi> whether, becauſe it lay not much out of his way, he determined to trauell to ſée the faſhion of the <hi>French</hi> Court, which then floriſhed with noble Dames, among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:150602:85"/> her fayre daughter <hi>Oliua,</hi> whom as before wee haue ſaide, was begotten by the famous Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> her betrothed huſband, the night before he departed towards the inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Caſtle, together with a goodly ſonne called <hi>Hendritio:</hi> both which Children, were very carefully educated by the good King <hi>Carolus</hi> theyr grand-father. And béeing nowe come vnto the age of ſixtéene yéeres, the young <hi>Hendritio</hi> was exerciſed in riding of horſes, &amp; running at tylt, wherin he ſhewed himſelfe not any way vnlike to the noble Prince his Father, hauing a great deſire to be knighted, whcih by no meanes his Grand-father would permit, fearing leaſt he would hazard himſelfe in that aduenture, whereof there had ſo many failed.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Oliua</hi> in like ſort, béeing of moſt ſinguler and rare beautie, could ſcarce be ſuffered to be once out of the ſight of her Grand mother, who loued her more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her owne Children: and being now as we haue ſaid, at the Citty of <hi>Towers,</hi> (the Quéene partly for her owne content, but chiefely for to delight the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia</hi> her Daughter, who continually ſince the loſſe of the Engliſh Prince, had ſpent her time in great ſorrow, onely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which ſhée had in her children, did a little mittigate the ſame) did daily vſe to ride foorth on hunting, into the forreſt which was euen hard adioyning to the Citty, in which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, there was great ſtore of all manner of wilde Beaſtes. And béeing the ſame day that the Knight of Fortune was comming to the Court, gone foorth very early, the Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had rouſed a mighty Hart, which making way before the hounds, cauſed all the Lords and Ladies to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gallopping very ſwiftly through the Forreſt, had quickly ſeparated themſelues into many companies, ſo that with the Quéene there was left no more but the Princeſſe <hi>Oliua,</hi> and two or thrée other Ladies, and ſome three or foure Knights, when ſuddenly a mighty great Giant, all armed, iſſued out from the thickeſt of the wood, and with a meruailous fierce countenance came towards them, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Quéene &amp; the other Ladies, who
<pb facs="tcp:150602:86"/> began to flie as faſt as their horſes could carry them. One of the Knights that was with the Quéene, béeing more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die then his fellowes, ſtayd to make reſiſtance whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſcaped: but alas, ſmall was the defence which hee could make being vnarmed, againſt ſo mighty a foe, whoſe huge Armour he was not able to pierce, although thereon he brake his Boreſpeare which he had in his hand all to ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and drawing out his ſword to try if that would doe any better, before hee could deliuer any ſtroke there with, was himſelfe clouen to the middle. And leauing him there, the Giant perſued the others, which by this time had gained a great way before him: and comming into a rough ſtony way, the horſe wheron y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe <hi>Oliua</hi> rode ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, not béeing able to recouer againe. Which ſhe perceiuing, beganne to flie on foote, whereby in ſhort ſpace, the Gyant had gained a great deale of ground of her, ſo that within leſſe then a quarter of a mile hée muſt néeds haue ouertaken her, had not the Knight of Fortune, (béeing as is aforeſaid, riding towards the Citty <hi>Towers</hi>) hapned to arriue: who at the firſt ſéeing a farre of one run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo faſt, was preſently touched with the remembrance of his former viſion: and calling to his Squire, put on his Helmet, and taking his Launce in his hand, rode towards them, when preſently the Lady (béeing cleane wearied and out of breath) caſt herſelfe downe before him, not béeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeake a word.</p>
               <p>The Knight viewing her ſinguler beauty, knew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently that it was the ſame Lady who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his fancie hee had vowed to ſerue: wherefore incouraging himſelfe, thinking that now was the time, if euer, to ſhew himſelfe valerous, béeing in her preſence, and in her cauſe, for whoſe ſake hée could indure a thouſand deaths, ſpake vnto her in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Moſt beautifull Lady, comfort your ſelfe, and feare not this huge lump of fleſh which hath purſued you, for I doubt not, but God will ſo ſtrengthen mine arme, as I ſhall ſoone be able to make him confeſſe his folly, in going about to wrong ſo heauenly a creature. Then ſetting ſpurres to his
<pb facs="tcp:150602:86"/> horſe, he ranne againſt the Giant, who by this time was come almoſt vnto them, and hitting him full in the midſt of the maſſy ſhield which he wore, hanging by a ſtirrup about his necke, gaue him ſuch a blow, that piercing the ſame, he cauſed him to ramble backwards, béeing hardly able to ſtand vpon his legges, breaking his Launce all to peeces. Thus hauing ended his courſe, he turned about, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that in fighting on horſebacke, hee might be in great danger if the Giant ſhould kill his horſe, hee allighted, and dreſſing his Shield on his arme, hee drew foorth his ſword, going boldly to méete his huge enemie: who hauing reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered himſelfe of the incounter, likewiſe went towards the Knight, with a mighty Semiter in his hand, thinking at the firſt blow to haue cleft him in two. But he being wary, eaſily auoided the ſame, by ſhifting his body aſide, the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant hauing miſt his blow, was not able to recouer his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter ſo lightly, (which was entred almoſt a foote into the ground) but that the Knight taking the aduantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gaue him a ſore blow on the left arme, almoſt at the ſhoulder, which piercing his thicke Armour cut him to the bone, the griefe whereof was ſuch, that hee could not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rule his maſſy targe ſo well as otherwiſe he would, by which meanes he had great aduantage: for now the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant béeing forced to lay on, and onely to truſt to his ſword both for offence and defence, many times receiued wound vpon wound: ſometimes likewiſe faſtning blowes on his aduerſary, hee would cauſe him to bend his knées to the ground, renting his Armor where he touched, and cauſing the blood to iſſue out thereof in many places. Thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued they a long time, the aduantage, if there were any, remaining with the Knight of Fortune.</p>
               <p>By this time had the Princeſſe <hi>Oliua</hi> recouered herſelfe againe, and although ſhée ſaw the Knight to haue the better ſide, yet the feare which ſhe had was ſuch, that ſhee would haue fled away ſhe wiſt not whether, had it not béen for the Knights Squire, who comming vnto her, perſwaded her with many arguments to ſtay and ſée the end, which hee
<pb facs="tcp:150602:87"/> was certaine could not be without the death of the Gyant, for that his Lord did continually increaſe vpon him, and whoſe vallour he knew to be ſuch, that the longer hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, the more increaſed his courage: but put caſe the Giant ſhould haue the victory, yet would it of force be with ſuch danger to himſelfe, that they néeded not to feare his purſute. The Princeſſe being ſomething héerewith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, was contented to ſtay the end, yet not beeing fully reſolued of feare, ſhe intreated the Squire to helpe mount her on his Maiſters horſe, which he did, then ſitting to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the combat, ſhe queſtioned with him of many matters touching his Maiſter, whom in her hart ſhee greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, demaunding what and of whence hee was. To which his Squire replied, that hee was diſcended of noble blood, but for his name and Country, he might not diſcloſe to any one, being commaunded to the contrary, only this, he called himſelfe the Knight of Fortune. Then declaring vnto her his firſt combat at Sea, and the battaile with <hi>Signior Roberto,</hi> when hee deliuered the Lady <hi>Beleriza:</hi> where hearing of the ſtrange reports of the inchaunted Caſtle, he determined to make triall thereof, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to declare vnto her his Maiſters Viſion at Sea, which more then all the reſt did cauſe her to admire, thinking with her ſelfe that it was only by the worke of God: then conſidering what it was to bee loued by ſuch a Knight, whoſe equall ſhe neuer had before ſéene, beganne déeply to fancie him. Thus paſt they away the time, whiles the two fierce Champions continued their combat, both giuing and receauing many wounds, all the ground bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtayned with their blood: and now the Giant being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inraged, rebelling and curſing his falſe Gods, foming at the mouth like a mad man, ranne vppon the Knight, thinking to haue taken him in his armes, but hée perceauing his intent, and lothing ſuch imbracements, preuented him by auoyding through the quickneſſe of his body, deliuering withall ſo ſound a blowe on his right arme, which he had ſtretched foorth, that he cauſed both it
<pb facs="tcp:150602:87"/> and his heauie Semiter to fly into the field, then perſuing his victory, he neuer left wounding of him, till ſuch time as he cauſed him to fall dead to the ground.</p>
               <p>And then parting his head from his ſhoulders, he knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe on his knées, rending thankes to God for the victory: and taking vp the head, hee went and preſented the ſame to the Princeſſe, deſiring her to accept the ſame, as the firſt ſhowe of his loue, who had vowed himſelfe wholy to her ſeruice. The Princeſſe dying her chéekes with a moddeſt bluſh, giuing him harty thankes for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her life, ſhe intreated him to conduct her to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where ſhe would cauſe him to be honored according to his deſert. The Knight eaſily conſented héereto, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bound vp this wounds, cauſed his Squire to place her behind him, in this ſort rode they onwards, the Knight declaring vnto her his loue, which he had vowed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſéene her, only by his viſion which he had ſéene, when firſt he left his owne Country. Whilſt they were thus diſcourſing of loue, they perceaued a great troope of Knights, comming galloping towards them, which when they were come néere vnto them, the Princeſſe knewe them to be the Quéenes Knights: who being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and finding her wanting, were ſent to purſue the Giant, and now hauing found her ſo well reſcued, they were not a little glad thereof: meruailing greatly how ſhe had eſcaped. And demaunding of her, were giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the whole diſcourſe before recited, wherein ſhee did not faile to extoll the Knights vallor to the vttermoſt: but hee attributed his victory more to her beauty then his owne vallour. Thus rode they on till they came to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one of the Knights carrying the Giants head, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great wonder of the whole Citty, who highly commended ſo vallerous a déede. And comming to the Court, they were receaued with great ioy by the Quéene, and the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia.</hi> who aſſuredly eſtéemed her loſt: but when they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the manner how ſhee was deliuered, they gaue God harty thankes, greatly honoring and commending
<pb facs="tcp:150602:88"/> the Knight of fortune, feaſting and intertaining him with all the kindneſſe that might be, and being lodged in the Pallace, was euery day during the cure of his wounds, viſited by the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia</hi> and her daughter, vnto whom many times hee declared his paſſions: which the Princeſſe perceauing to be extreame, beganne ſomething to pitty him, which <hi>Cupid</hi> perceauing, and minding to ſhowe his diuine power, wounded her to the hart with one of his impoyſoned ſhafts, whereby ſhee could neuer bée in quiet but in his preſence: which hee perceauing, beganne farre ſooner then otherwiſe he could haue done, to recouer his ſtrength, ſo that within fiftéene daies he was throughly whole, and being able to beare Armor againe, determined to trauel towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inchaunted Caſtle, but firſt he thought good once more to try the Princeſſe, as you ſhall heare in the Chapter following.</p>

               <p>Moſt excellent &amp; beautious Princeſſe, if the cruell paines of a faithfull Louer, may any way mooue compaſſion in a Ladies hart, or the endleſſe ſighes and teares of a Knight wounded by <hi>Cupids</hi> ſhafts, may deſerue to be pittied, then I beſeech you Madam to behold him, that not onely langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, but is euen ready, through the extreame paſſions

               <p>The Princeſſe hearing this, which vnto her was moſt pleaſant, anſwered, Knight of Fortune, what other name to call you by I am vtterly ignorant of, the loue which you ſay you beare vnto me, may be great, neither doo I thinke the contrary, as the hazarding of your ſelfe to ſaue my life, I muſt néedes confeſſe deſerues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt recompence that I can beſtow on you. But how farre vnfitting it is for one of my eſtate, to place my affection on a ſtranger, whoſe name nor Country I know not, yea peraduenture on ſuch a one, who though now he ſeemes to loue, yet hauing gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what he ſéekes for, may as ſoone leaue me: but put caſe I were ſo fondly bent, as not looking before I leapt, ſhould place my affection on you, doo you thinke, that eyther the King my Grandfather, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of my friends would giue conſent to my choiſe, ſurely I am perſwaded they would neuer yéeld thereto.</p>
               <p>The Knight hauing attentiuely liſtned to her diſcourſe, and withall noting her change of culler whilſt that ſhe was ſpeaking, eſpecially when ſhée ſéemed to make doubt of his conſtancie, replyed. Worthy Princeſſe, whoſe beautie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the moſt fayreſt, and whoſe wiſedome excelleth that beautie, my name, which vnto none ſince I left my owne Country I haue declared, is <hi>Iago,</hi> my natiue ſoile the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Saxony</hi> where my aged Father gouerns, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is become of me his vnhappy ſonne, who for the deſire of ſéeking ſtrange aduentures, ſtale ſecretly out of his Court, what ſince hath befalne me, I thinke partly by my ſelfe, and my Squire you haue already heard. But where you ſéeme to doubt of my loyaltie, I beſéech God no longer to permit my life, then vnto you I proue faithfull: &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you likewiſe doubt your friends conſents, thinke not but

The Princeſſe no longer able to conceale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue which ſhe bare him, and knowing him to be the Prince of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> whoſe forwardneſſe long before by fame had béen bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>French</hi> Court, together with that of his ſuppoſed Brother, the Gentleman of the Forreſt, demaunded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were himſelfe or his Brother, that had atchieued the aduenture of the inchaunted Sword. The Knight anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was his ſuppoſed brother, whoſe abſence was the chiefeſt cauſe of his trauell. And herewithall hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her, the ſtrange finding of <hi>Euordanus,</hi> together with the great loue and affection betweene them, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared: at which diſcourſe the Princeſſe tooke great delight, and in the end, hauing fully reſolued with herſelfe, ſhe was contented to take him for her huſband. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus vowed each to other fayth and loyaltie, hee tooke his leaue of her with many a chaſt kiſſe: the next day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelfe to trauell towards the inchaunted Caſtle, where within ſixe dayes after hee arriued, reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning. And béeing come euen to the Bridge foote, hee was willed by a Squire to paſſe no further, then preſently came foorth the Giant <hi>Brandofell,</hi> mounted on a mightie Courſer, bearing in his hand a Lance big enough to haue béen the Maſt of a ſmall ſhyppe. Which when the Knight of Fortune beheld, hee greatly admired the ſame, yet not béeing any thing afraid, he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, addreſſing his ſhield, and placing his Launce in his reſt, which he directed right againſt the Giants breaſt, who by reaſon of his huge ſtature, bare his Launce ſo hie, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together, he ranne the ſame cleane ouer his head, not ſo much as once touching him therewith: but the Knights Launce hitting in the midſt of the Giants ſhielde, brake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thouſand ſhiuers, cauſing the huge tower to bend back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but yet kéeping his ſaddle, they met together ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with their bodies, that they were both horſe &amp; men
<pb facs="tcp:150602:89"/> tumbled to the ground, (to the great meruaile of the prince <hi>Don Edward</hi> and the other Knights, which were ſtanding on the battlements of the Caſtle beholding the ſame, who greatly commended him in their harts,) then quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering themſelues, they drew foorth theyr ſwords, and comming together, they began a moſt cruell and dangerous combat: the Knight ſtill fearing his mighty blowes, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten voyde the ſame by the quickneſſe of his bodie: but yet many times receiued wound vppon wound, himſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe giuing many.</p>
               <p>Thus continued they the ſpare of two howres without any great aduantage to be diſcerned betwéene them: the Giant at length beginning to be out of breath, beganne to giue back a little, which the Knight perceiuing folowed him the faſter, and the Giant ſtill giuing back, hapned to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on a péece of the Knights Launce, wherewith he fell to the ground: ſo that before he could recouer himſelfe, he had receiued two great wounds, the one in his thigh, the other in his right arme, whereby (béeing againe gotten on his féete) he could not ſo well handle his Semiter as before hée did, which was ſoone the occaſion that the Knight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune got the victorie, yet very déerly, for hauing the Giant at this aduantage, he determined to end the Combat quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and croching neere, the better to giue a full blow at his head, he performed the ſame with ſuch force, that hée cauſed him to tumble to the ground, receiuing withall ſo mightie a blow from the Giant on the right ſide, that cleauing his ſhield in two, he was thereby ſore wounded in the ſhoulder and in his arme.</p>
               <p>But euen as he was going to be reuenged thereof, by cutting of his head, the Gyant <hi>Furoll</hi> came vnto him, and by force taking him in his armes, doe what he could, he carried him into the Caſtle, where being diſarmed, he had his wounds very carefully looked vnto, at the intreaty of the Prince, who greatly liked him for his vallour, which he had ſhowed in the combat with <hi>Brandofell.</hi> And beeing cured of his wounds, was alwaies by the Prince held as
<pb facs="tcp:150602:90"/> a companion, vnto whom hee declared the deliuery of his daughter from the Gyant <hi>Latron,</hi> and of the great ſorrow which the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia</hi> indured for his impriſonment.

And being héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concluded, they directed their courſe towards the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, where within tenne daies after they arriued, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length come to the Caſtle, in the morning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what early, hauing reſted themſelues the night before in a Village on the edge of the Forreſt: where they were giuen to vnderſtand, of the great vallour of the Knight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who ſome fiftéene daies before was taken priſoner, whoſe loſſe was greatly bewailed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>French</hi> Court: the Knights being as I haue ſayd come vnto the Caſtle, had not long ſtayed, before ſuch time as <hi>Brandoſell</hi> beeing throughly cured of his wounds, which hee had receaued of the Knight of Fortune, came foorth mounted on his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Courſer, at whoſe hugeneſſe both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knights did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder, yet not being any whit diſmaide, <hi>Adreſto</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their agréement, tooke the other part of the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſetting ſpurres to their horſes, they met together with ſuch fury, that breaking their Launces to péeces, they paſſed on halfe aſtonied: &amp; hauing ended their courſe, <hi>Adreſto</hi> turning his horſe drew foorth his ſword: but the Gyant who neuer before had fought on horſe-back, was going to alight, which <hi>Adreſto</hi> perceauing, called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, telling him it was not the part of a Knight to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his horſe, as long as he was able to kéepe him on his backe. Which the Gyant hearing, and thinking with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that if fighting on horſe-backe, hee ſhould find any diſaduantage, hee might eaſily ſley his enemies horſe, it cauſed him drawing his heauy Semiter to vſe theſe ſpéeches. Knight, I was willing to haue delayed thy death for a while, which on foote might haue béene deferred by thy quickneſſe: but now ſéeing it is thy own doings to fight on horſe-backe, blame none but thy ſelfe for thy folly. Then comming both together, the Gyant had thought to haue deliuered a blow vpon his ſhield, but <hi>Adreſto</hi> being very wary auoyded the ſame by the quicke ſhifting of his horſe, giuing the Gyant a mighty blow on the right ſide, which
<pb facs="tcp:150602:93"/> he taking with his ſhield, ſlyced away a great part thereof. Which the Giant perceiuing, wondred at his ſtrength, ſo likewiſe did Prince <hi>Edward, Don Iago,</hi> and many other hardy Knights, who ſtoode on the battlement of the Caſtle to behold the combat, greatly commending the braue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of <hi>Adreſto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Prince <hi>Edward</hi> caſting his eye on the Knight of the Lyons, who was ſtill ſitting on horſebacke, began to haue a meruailous opinion of him, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> turning to <hi>Iago</hi> hee ſaid: that if his mind did not miſdéeme, that Knight on horſeback was the better of the two, and that if they did both fayle in this attempt, it was in vaine for them euer to expect deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Now had <hi>Adreſto</hi> and the Giant, continued theyr battell by the ſpace of halfe an howre on horſebacke, both of them hauing receiued many wounds, but eſpecially the Giant, who for want of ſkill receiued many more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he néeded to haue doone: which cauſed him to fret and chafe excéedingly. And béeing minded to delay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fight no longer, he raiſed himſelfe in his ſtirrups, and deliuered a full blow at his enemies head, who ſéeing it comming, and béeing afraid to take the ſame, hee lightly raind backe his horſe, ſo that the Giant miſſing his marke, was not able to recouer his blow, which lighted ſo fully on his owne horſe head, that he cleft it in two, and therewithall tumbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ground: but as great hap was, he fréed himſelfe ſo well in the fal, that before <hi>Adreſto</hi> could take any aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt him, he had recouered his féete, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, likewiſe allighted, and addreſſing himſelfe, they began a more fierce combat then that on horſebacke, the Giant ſtill hauing the worſt, till at laſt, <hi>Adreſto</hi> ſtepping backe to auoyde a blow which the Giant made at him, hée vnluckily ſtumbled, and withall fell to the ground, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the fall a great wound on his right thigh, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, and fearing the death of his friend, he leapt lightly from his horſe, and came to ſaue him, which was doone with ſuch ſpéede, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giant could not execute the crueltie which otherwiſe he would, but was
<pb facs="tcp:150602:93"/> forced to turne about to defend himſelfe from his newe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary: who beganne to deliuer him ſuch blowes, as made the beholders ſoone iudge who ſhould haue the victory. For he gaue not one blow in vaine, but it did eyther breake in peeces his Armor, or wound his body, which now through loſſe of blood began to grow weake. On the contrary ſide, his blowes which he gaue vnto the Knight, had not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force ſo much as once to pierce his ſhielde, ſo impregnable was the ſtrength thereof, which cauſed the Giant to curſe and blaſpheme his Gods, who were not able to deliuer him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one alone Knight. And béeing in this rage, he thought with one blow to haue finiſhed the battell, wherefore vniting all his forces together, he ſtrake the Knight ſuch a blow on the ſhield, that had it béen of any other mettell, he had cleft it in the midſt, but to this it did no harme at all, but with that blow he brake his Semiter, cauſing the Knight to ſet one knée to the ground: but béeing againe recouered, hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Giant with ſuch fierce blowes, that ſoone he cauſed him to fall at his féete: which <hi>Furioll</hi> perceiuing, cryed vnto him to ſaue his life, but the Knight not ſéeming to harken vnto him, cut off his head.</p>
               <p>The Giant <hi>Furioll</hi> ſéeing his companion ſlaine, drew forth a mighty broad Fauchon, and running at the knight ſaid: Villaine, wherfore haſt thou ſlaine him that was not able to defend himſelfe, I hauing likewiſe cryed vnto thee to haue ſpared him, but ſéeing thou haſt ſo cruely dealt with him, I will ſend thy ſoule for a ſacrifice vnto him. Doe thy worſt replyed the Knight, for I ſlew him becauſe I did not feare thée: and if thou looke not the better to thy ſelfe, I doubt not but to ſend thée to beare him company with the dead, whom liuing y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt béen a companion vnto in many miſchiefes, then hurling together, they beganne a cruell combat.</p>
               <p>The Knight hauing borne ſome two or thrée of his wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blowes, (which although by the goodnes of his Armour did not wound his body, yet were they of ſuch force y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did compell him to bend with his knées to the ground, and
<pb facs="tcp:150602:94"/> now minding with himſelfe to auoyde the ſame) began to round &amp; trauerſe his ground, often auoyding his enemies force, &amp; indangering his huge body both with blowes and thruſts, which hee gaue with ſuch good and ſkilfull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the blood iſſued foorth abundantly, to the great ioy and admiration of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince, and the reſt of the priſoners, who in a manner héereby were in aſſurance of their deliuery: wondring in theyr minds what he might be, that with ſuch force was able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with the Giant <hi>Furioll.</hi> Thus continued they fighting by the ſpace of two howres, not ſo much as once taking breath, whereby the Knight had the aduantage, as béeing more vſed to ſuch combats then the Giant, who now was in a manner cleane wearied, and ſo farre out of breath, that he did nothing but pant and blow, which the Knight perceiuing, purſued him the faſter, dealing ſuch blowes with the truſtie blade of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driano,</hi> that cauſed his body to lie open to the keene edge thereof, ſo that the graſſe wheron they fought, was cleane couered with his blood, himſelfe not hauing giuen any wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to his aduerſay, although in many places he had bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Armor: and now béeing ouercharged with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies blowes, and growing faint through his great phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottomy, fell to the ground in a ſwound. The Knight thinking to haue ſlaine him, was called vnto to haſten vnto the wicket, which if he did not make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater ſpéed, would be cloſed againſt him, wherefore leauing the Giant ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in his owne blood, he ranne vnto the gate, and finding one cloſing the wicket againſt him, he gaue him ſuch a blow that he cleft him to the breaſt: and entring in, hee began to deale his dole amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that made any reſiſtance, which were not many.</p>
               <p>Then came vnto him the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prince <hi>Don Iago</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, giuing him infinit thankes for his great paines, which hee had taken for their deliuery: deſiring him to put off his Helme, that they might ſee his face and knowe him, who had ſo nobly wrought their deliuerance. The Knight beeing loth to deny their requeſt, eſpecially that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince
<pb facs="tcp:150602:94"/> 
                  <hi>Iago,</hi> whom hee perfitly knew, and of whoſe being there he did not a little meruaile, whithout any more ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies put of his Helme. But when the whole company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his young yeares and great beauty, which by his heate was the more augmented, they did greatly admire his rare proweſſe: but what man liuing is able to expreſſe the excéeding ioy, which the Prince <hi>Iago</hi> inioyed when hée beheld him: who running preſently vnto him, imbraſt him in his armes, ſaying. O brother, how happy am I ſo inioy this your preſence in a time ſo néedfull: whoſe abſence hath béen a greater griefe vnto me then my tongue can expreſſe. The Knight of the Lions being as glad to ſée him, vſed him with the like kindneſſe, demaunding by what aduenture he came thether, and how the Duke his father, his Mother, and the Princeſſe his ſiſter fared, all which was deferred vntill a more conuenient time. Then was hee imbraced of the Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and the reſt, at whoſe intreaty he pardoned Sir <hi>Peſtrell</hi> the Dukes Coſin: and for the courtiſie which hee had ſhowed them, during their impriſonment, they vſed him very kindly. Then the Knight of the Lions commaunded <hi>Adreſto</hi> to be ſent for, and his wounds to be dreſſed, declaring vnto the Prince <hi>Iago,</hi> that it was the ſame Knight for whom he left <hi>Saxonie</hi> to goe into <hi>Ireland</hi> to combat with all. Héere after they had reſted themſelues by the ſpace of fiue daies, hauing ſent word of this fortunate deliuerance, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> they determined altogether to ride thether, where in thrée daies they arriued with eaſie iournies, by reaſon of the wounds of <hi>Adreſto.</hi> And at their comming foorth of the Caſtle, with a mighty clap of thunder, the Caſtle and dead bodies of the Gyants were vaniſht cleane out of ſight, to the great aſtoniſhment of them all.</p>
               <p>And now being as I haue ſayd come to the Citty of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> they were royally welcomed, and intertained by the King, the Quéene, the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia, Oliua:</hi> and all Nobles of the Court, vnto whom the Prince of <hi>England,</hi> declared the whole diſcourſe of euery particuler accedent,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:95"/> touching their impriſonment and deliuery. Which when the King had heard, he made a ſolemne vow to be reuenged on the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and his whole family: but at the intreaty of the Prince, he pardoned Sir <hi>Peſtrell,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards prooued a good and hardy Knight. Thus paſſed they away the time in the <hi>French</hi> Court, by the ſpace of thrée wéekes, each friend recounting to other their ſeuerall aduentures, and making preparation for the ſolemnizing of the marriage betwéene Prince <hi>Edward</hi> &amp; the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> in which time <hi>Adreſto</hi> was fully recouered of his wounds, and being deſirous to ſee his old loue the Dutches <hi>Lenarda,</hi> haſtned on the Knight of the Lions to depart: whereunto he was very willing, by reaſon of the deſire he had to ſpeake with <hi>Adriano.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. How the Knight of the Lions, departing from the <hi>French</hi> Court with <hi>Adresto,</hi> landed in <hi>Holland,</hi> where comming to the Caſtle of <hi>Coruew,</hi> hee deliuered the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now beeing ready prouided to depart, they came both into the great Hall, where with many ceremonious courtiſies, they tooke their leaue of the King, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene, the Princeſſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> and <hi>Oliua,</hi> with all the reſt of the Nobles of the Court. The two Princes, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>Iago,</hi> ſéeing they would néedes depart, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them two daies iourny onwards on their way, during which time the Prince <hi>Iago</hi> deſiring pardon of his brother, for not bearing him company, made knowne vnto him his loue to the Princeſſe <hi>Oliua,</hi> which by his abode in Court, he doubted not but to obtaine, conſidering the great loue and amity, which was betwéene him and her father. The Knight of the Lions being well contented héerewith, deſired him at his returne, or ſending into <hi>Saxonie,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his duty to the Duke, and Ductches, and his
<pb facs="tcp:150602:95"/> beautifull ſiſter the Princeſſe <hi>Egiſena,</hi> whom hee intirely loued: aſſuring him that as ſoone as he could learne any certainty, of that which he now went to ſéeke for, he would returne thether likewiſe, which hee did not doubt but would hapen very ſhortly. Then taking their leaue of each other, with many kind imbracements, the Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> moſt earneſtly intreated him, to ſée him at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne out of <hi>Spaine</hi> at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, to which he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſented. Thus they departed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Princes towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, &amp; the Knight of the Lions &amp; <hi>Adreſto,</hi> towards the Sea-ſide, where their ſhip remained for them: where bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriued, and ſetting into Sea, they ſailed merrily by the ſpace of two daies, but on the third day the wind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, and the Seas growing very foule, they were forced to put to hull: and being thus toſt to and fro by the wind and Seas, by the ſpace of fiue daies, they were at laſt put on ſhore on the coaſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Holland:</hi> where go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſhore, and taking their horſes and Armor, minding a little to take the aire after their ſtorme at Sea, they rode onwards in a narrow way, faſt by a pleaſant groues ſide, where they heard one very pittifully weeping, and liſtning attentiuely, they might heare theſe few words pronounced. And is it poſſible that God will ſuffer ſuch cruell and iniuſt cuſtomes to continue, to the deſtruction of ſo many braue and hardie Knights, as haue béene by this wicked cuſtome of <hi>Coruew</hi> deſtroyed. O falſe and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Griffory,</hi> that fearing to ſhew thy malice openly, haſt ordained ſo vild a cuſtome.</p>
               <p>The two Knights hearing this complaint, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was ſome cauſe extraordinary which mooued the party ſo to complaine, alighted, and went into the Groue, where they found a Squire lying on the earth, his face all blubbred with teares, and demaunding him the cauſe of his ſorrow, was giuen by him to vnderſtand of the cuſtome of <hi>Coruew,</hi> where not long ſince the Duke of <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenburge</hi> his Lord and Maiſter, hauing bin by the ſpace of 20. yéeres trauelling in ſearch of his ſoueraigne, the noble
<pb facs="tcp:150602:96"/> King <hi>Frederick</hi> of Denmark, during which time he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed many great and hardy déedes of Armes, and now returning home into his owne Country, with intent no longer to ſéeke after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was impoſſible to be found, trauailing along by a Caſtle not paſſing a daies iourney hence, where the Duke of this Country hath erected a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that no Knight ſhall paſſe that way, but firſt he ſhall leaue his horſe and Armor behind him, vnleſſe hee conquer the Gardants, which is a thing impoſſible, becauſe of the number: and then he declared the fame as it is more at large expreſſed in the firſt part of this hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Lyons and <hi>Adreſto</hi> hearing of this cuſtome, and greatly pittying the loſſe of ſo many hardie Knights as were there daily impriſoned, beganne to grow into a great longing to make triall of the ſame: wherefore ſending backe <hi>Gillimo</hi> vnto the ſhip for ſuch things as they wanted, and to giue direction to the Marriners, that if with in ten dayes they did not returne, that then they ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their courſe for <hi>Spayne,</hi> whether they would peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture trauell by Land: and willing <hi>Gillimo</hi> to follow them with as much ſpéede as hee could, they departed towards <hi>Coruew,</hi> that night lying at a Village not paſſing a league and a halfe from the Caſtle. And the next day early in the morning hauing heard Diuine ſeruice, and taking a ſmall repaſt, they rode directly towards the Caſtle. <hi>Adreſto</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deſired to make the firſt triall of his vallour, and now beeing come vnto the place where the Shield hung at the bridge-foote, <hi>Adreſto</hi> ſtrooke the ſame ſo hard and rudely with the blunt end of his Launce, that he cauſed the whole Vally to reſound with the noyſe thereof. Preſently iſſued foorth one of the Knights gardants, and mounting on his horſe, came vnto <hi>Adreſto</hi> demaunding what hee ſought. Entrance aunſwered <hi>Adreſto,</hi> which if it be denied I will purchaſe with my ſword. Then ſetting ſpurres to theyr horſes, they met together with ſuch fury, that the Knight of the bridge was ſent headlong to the ground: and after him came foorth another, who was likewiſe ſent to beare him
<pb facs="tcp:150602:96"/> company, breaking his necke with the fall, <hi>Adreſto</hi> neuer ſo much as once moouing in his ſaddle: and to be briefe, ſo good was his hap, that with one ſpeare hee diſmounted the firſt fiue Knights, not any of them béeing able to riſe from the ground. Then taking choice of a freſh horſe, and a new Launce, for that his old one was remaining broken in the body of him whom hee laſt diſmounted, hee went on to the farther end of the Bridge, where he found two of the other fiue ready mounted, and vailing their Launces, they ranne together in ſuch ſort, that breaking both their Launces on his ſhield, it cauſed him a little to ſtagger: but he with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Adreſto</hi> met, was ſent to meaſure his length on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, then encountring with the other againe, hee ran his launce cleane through his body, himſelfe béeing a little wounded on the right ſide.</p>
               <p>Then taking a new Launce, hee prepared to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other thrée, but before he ranne, the Knight of the Lyons intreated him to giue ouer the Iouſts to him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more freſh and luſtie: but héereunto <hi>Adreſto</hi> would not in any ſort agrée, but deſired him to permit him to end the aduenture if he could: and if hee did faile therein, then that he would procéede in the ſame himſelfe. And héerewithall againe he ſette ſpurres to his horſe, and encountring with them all thrée at once, gaue him that was on the right ſide of him ſuch a blow, that he cauſed him to fall ouer his horſe taile: but the other two méeting him fully at one inſtant, brake theyr Launces in the midſt of his ſhield, cauſing both horſe and man to tumble to the ground, but ſoone had hee recouered his féete, and was againe remounted by his Squire, who brought him his owne horſe, &amp; preſented him with a Launce. Then béeing mounted, he incountred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the other two, who at the ſecond courſe he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent to beare theyr fellowes company, himſelfe béeing ſore bruſed and wounded in two or thrée places of the body, wherby he loſt a great deale of blood: and likewiſe his horſe was ſo ouerwearied, that hee was no longer able to beare his body. Wherfore he diſmounted, minding to haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:150602:97"/> his horſe, but as hee was ſo dooing, hee eſpied the fiue Knights with whom he was to deale withall comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him on foote, wherfore drawing forth his ſword, and dreſſing his ſhield on his arme, he went againſt them with a moſt bold and vndaunted courage: and béeing come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was the firſt that gaue the onſet, which hee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſuch ineſtimable proweſſe, that within leſſe then twenty blowes, he had ſent one of them to ſéeke paſſage of old <hi>Caron:</hi> the reſt perceiuing the death of theyr fellow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with more furie to aſſault him, whereby he was driuen to his trumps, for they were all foure ſtoute and hardy Knights. Thus continued the fight by the ſpace of an howre, many wounds béeing giuen on both ſides, ſo that the ground was all couered with blood: and now <hi>Adreſto</hi> féeling himſelfe grieuouſly wounded, &amp; his ſtrength through weariſomneſſe &amp; loſſe of blood to decreaſe, minding to ſhew courage to the end, vnited all his forces together, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to end his life with honour, ranne fiercely vpon them, giuing one of them ſuch a blow on the head, that hée cleft him to the téeth: then turning to another of them who had wounded him behind, gaue him ſuch a diſcharge, that for euer after he was frée from any more ſuch combats, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both his armes cut off. The other two ſéeing this, and fearing the like, would willingly if they could haue deſiſted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the battel: but he purſued them with ſo mighty blowes, that at length they fell both at his féete, the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtarke dead, the other crying for mercy, which he obtained.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Adreſto</hi> béeing very faint, ſate downe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graſſe, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, came towards him to helpe him, but before hée could come vnto him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſto</hi> was falne into a ſwound: wherefore commending him vnto their Squires, hee prepared himſelfe againſt the other fiue Knights, which by this time were come euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and at the firſt incounter, gaue one of them ſo rude a blow, that cutting away both ſhoulder and right arme, hée cauſed him to fall dead to the ground, then turning to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he tooke of at one blow his head.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150602:97"/>
               <p>The other thrée ſéeing this, beſet him round about, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him withall their force, which was far weake to doe him any hurt: ſo impierceable was his Armor, which at this time ſtoode him in good ſtéede, for hee being ſure from wounding, néeded not to take any paines but only in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, which he did with ſuch agillity, that in leſſe then halfe an houre, hee had ſent them all to ſéeke paſſage into another world. Then had he time a little to breath himſelfe, and alſo to ſée <hi>Adreſto,</hi> who by this time, by the carefull induſtrie of the Squires, was come to himſelfe againe, and had his wounds bound vp, being ſomewhat weake and fainty, with his great loſſe of blood which he ſuſtained. And now the Knight of the Lions, ſéeing there was no great doubt of his recouery, went towards the Caſtle, to prouoke the Gardants, if otherwiſe they would not com foorth, to the battaile.</p>
               <p>But euen as hee was come to the gate, fiue whoſe lot was next to fight came foorth, and all at once ſet on him, but he like a ſecond <hi>Hercules,</hi> amidſt the eleauen Gyant-like brethren, firſt receaued al their blowes vpon his ſhield, to try the ſtrength of their armes, and hauing once felt the weight of all their forces, he directed his ſword againſt him, whoſe blowes hee thought might doe him the greateſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: and giuing him a full blow beneath the ſhield, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him right in the waſt, then laying on amongſt them with equall dole, he made from ſome their heads, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their armes and legges to fly into the field. And now foure of them being kild in the place, the other beganne to fly as faſt as he could towards the wicked, but before hée could attaine halfe of the way, the Knight of the Lions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertooke him, &amp; gaue him ſo full a blow vpon the head, that he cleft him downe to the girdle: to the amazement of the beholders, who ſtoode vpon the battlements of the Caſtle, almoſt fearing to goe foorth to fight with him, but being vrged, both by their oath, and alſo by the commaundement of their Captaine, the nex fiue went foorth, but were in a manner no ſooner iſſued, but that they ſought meanes to
<pb facs="tcp:150602:98"/> returne againe, ſuch incredible feare had they of his weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty blowes. But hée ſéeing their intent, and minding to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the ſame, got lighty betwéene the gate and them: and now hauing already ſlaine thrée of them, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the other two, hee beganne to fall into conſideration with himſelfe, that if he did not take the time, whiles it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelfe vnto him to enter into the Caſtle, he might when he would, peraduenture be bard of the like oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And conſidering withall the goodneſſe of his Armor, &amp; vnwillingneſſe of the defendants to come foorth, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to enter whilſt the wicket was open: wherefore ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a little to the right hand, he gaue one of them ſo ſore a blow on the left ſhoulder, that cauſed him to fall to the ground, and héerewithall hee lept ſuddenly to the wicket, and got in thereat: which they of the Caſtle perceauing, and with all fearing the ſequell, bee ganne to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and all at once to aſſault him, ſome with ſwords, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Launces, ſome others againe betooke them to throwing of ſtones, &amp; diuers engines of iron at him, where with he was greatly troubled. But ſeeing no remedy, but either to conquer or die, he couered himſelfe with his ſhield, and with his truſty blade in his hand, hee made ſuch way amongſt them, that he thought himſelfe ſureſt, that was fartheſt off from him: ſo that within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of two houres, he had not left aboue ſixe of them liuing: all which were likewiſe very ſore wounded, &amp; beeing vtterly voyd of hope to eſcape his conquering arme, determined to ſubmit themſelues to his mercy, hoping thereby to ſaue their liues, which otherwiſe they could not long preſerue. Wherefore falling on their knées, with one voice they cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mercy, which he ſoone graunted vnto them, being as I haue many times before ſaid, naturally inclined to pitty. And willing them to ſtand vp, hee demaunded what priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there were in the Caſtle, and for what occaſion that cuſtome was there erected: all which one of them at large recounted, declaring how that the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> as yet remained there, with diuers other noble and gallant
<pb facs="tcp:150602:98"/> Knights. Which when the Knight of the Lions heard, hée commaunded ſtraight waies to be conducted vnto the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and likewiſe that <hi>Adreſto</hi> ſhould be brought in, and his wounds dreſſed by the Surgian of the Caſtle, which was a man greatly experienced in that ſcience, all which was preſently performed. And one of the Knights running to one of them that was ſlaine, tooke from him a bunch of keyes, wherewith he opened a little iron doore, and diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe a narrow paire of ſtaiers, they came to a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vnderground, at the entry whereof was another iron doore, which they likewiſe opened: then hauing a torch lighted in their hands, they vnchained all the priſoners, amongſt whom they found King <hi>Frederick,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>Gwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi> his Coſin: the Duke of <hi>Litſenburge,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi> Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> and diuers others, to the number of a hundred, all or moſt part Knights of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> Many of which were ſore pined away, and almoſt famiſhed through their extreame griefe and courſe fare: but the King, the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> were little or nothing altred for all their long impriſonment. And now being all brought foorth into the great Hall of the Caſtle, they with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord gaue harty thankes vnto the Knight of the Lions, and then falling on their knées, with one conſent they gaue praiſes to almighty God, which being ended: the King with the noble men came vnto the Knight of the Lions, deſiring him to declare who hee was, that they were ſo much bound vnto for their deliuerance. To which hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hee was commonly called the Knight of the Lions: But as touching his parents or Country, he knew not, only this he had heard, that being a child, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp in a Forreſt, in the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> who ſince that time had carefully brought him vp as his ſonne. Which when the King had heard hée imbraſt him in his armes, deſiring him to accompany him into his Kingdome, where hee would ſhowe himſelfe ſo thankfull vnto him, as hee ſhould not thinke his labour ill beſtowed. The Knight beeing by the inſtinct of nature,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:99"/> greatly affected vnto the King, ſoone conſented héereto, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were farre out of his way towards <hi>Spaine,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was trauelling. For which the King gaue him har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thankes, and withall beganne to haue an inward loue towards him: héere continued they by the ſpace of eight or tenne daies, to refreſh their weake bodies, as alſo for the curing of the wounds of <hi>Adreſto,</hi> and making preparation for their Armors, whereof they had great ſtore in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, &amp; ſome horſes: others they got abroade in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try néere adioyning for their monies. And now hearing that <hi>Grifforie</hi> was gathering his forces to come againſt them, they departed towards <hi>Flaunders,</hi> where hearing of the warres and rebellion in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> they determined vnknowne to haſten thether, and naming themſelues to be all Knights arrant, met together by chance: and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe warres were, minded to entertaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the armie of the States. With this determination arriued they at the Citty of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which was ſtill held by the <hi>Danes:</hi> and héere they remained, to prouide themſelues of ſuch things as they néeded.</p>

And now béeing héere arriued, the King and the reſt béeing diſguiſed for feare of being knowne, came vnto the States, deſiring entertainement, and withall, declared a long fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned circumſtance how they had met together: and béeing all minded to ayde theyr right and iuſt cauſe againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> and traytors, they were come together to proffer their ſeruices. The States béeing glad of this ſuccor, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all knowing diuers of them, as the Duke of <hi>Litſenburge,</hi> and others, whom they receiued with great ioy, and gaue entertainment to all the reſt, who by the meanes of the Duke were placed in commaund: and entring into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, they determined to ſend preſently vnto the <hi>Scots</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund battell, which by the Earle <hi>Dowglaſſe</hi> was ſoone graunted: and the next day it was appointed that it ſhould be tryed by a pitched battell who ſhould haue the victory.</p>
               <p>The morning béeing come, and both Armies ranged in the field, the States had deuided their forces into thrée bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, the firſt whereof was ledde by the Lord <hi>Louden,</hi> and the County of <hi>Mildrope,</hi> containing eight thouſand, the ſecond or maine battell, was ledde by the Duke of <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenburge,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Opencade,</hi> containing twelue thouſand, the third &amp; laſt battalion, contayning nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, was led by the Lord <hi>Itzenho,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Renſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge.</hi> The King, the Knight of the Lyons, with their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, &amp; ſome others, to the number of two hundred, would not at all ioyne themſelues with any of the troopes, but in a looſe manner, would make a tryall to breake in on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> backs of their enemies as ſoone as the battell ſhould begin: each one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their better knowledge to theyr friends, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on their Helmes a croſſe of gréene and corronation co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured ſilke: in this ſort was ranged the whole battell of the States.</p>
               <p>On the contrary ſide, the Earle <hi>Dowglaſſe</hi> placed his Army in another maner, making as it were but one maine
<pb facs="tcp:150602:100"/> battaile of his whole Armie, in the midſt whereof he placed for his owne gard fiue thouſand <hi>Scots:</hi> the reſt he intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Danes,</hi> the greateſt part whereof hee placed in the forefront of the battaile: his wings conſiſted moſt of a light kind of people, which did vſe to caſt Darts, beeing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely with a ſhort ſword and target, with which when they came to ioyne blowes, they did great ſpoyle to theyr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p>And now both Armies béeing thus ranged in battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, the Drummes &amp; Trumpets ſounded, making a moſt ioyfull ſound, to them whoſe harts not daunted with feare deſired to incounter with their enemies: euery Captaine incouraging his men to fight valiantly, and to doe their beſt to winne the victory. The chiefe of the ſtates incouraging theyr ſouldiers with the iuſtice of theyr cauſe, as beeing vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to fight for their fréedome and liberty of their Country. By this time were both Armies come together, the Lord <hi>Louden</hi> giuing the firſt charge vpon his enemies, brake his Launce valiantly, and drawing out his ſword, beeing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his company, made way through his enemies ranks, but ſoone he was ſtopped from going farre: and had it not béene, that the Duke of <hi>Litſenbege,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Opencade</hi> came with freſh ſuccours, they had béene all put to the ſword. For the <hi>Scots</hi> ſéeing the violent raſhneſſe of the Lord <hi>Louden</hi> and the Count <hi>Mildrope,</hi> opened theyr ranks of purpoſe, and hauing ſuffered them to enter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them round about, but now at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Duke, the battell began to grow very hote, inſomuch that there were many ſlaine of both ſides.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> euer kéeping themſelues cloſe together, made themſelues the ſtronger, whereas the States for want of ſkill and knowledge, ſuffered theyr troopes to breake theyr ranks, to theyr great dammage. Which the Earle <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe</hi> perceiuing, with ſome twelue or fouretéene thouſand entred in amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, making great ſlaughter where they went. The Earle this day ſhewing that his yéeres had not any way taken away the vallor which in his former dayes
<pb facs="tcp:150602:100"/> he had ſhowed, for it was thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this day hee ſlew with his owne hands aboue thréeſcore Knights.</p>
               <p>Now beganne the <hi>Danes</hi> to fly, truſting rather to their héeles then the defence of their ſwords, which the Lord <hi>Itzenho,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Rensberge</hi> perceauing, came in with the rereward, and againe renewed the fight, which before was almoſt ended, gathering together the diſperced troops of the Duke. But alas to ſmall purpoſe had this their new onſet béene, had it not béene that the King with his company of Venturers, hauing fetched about a great hill, which lay on the ſide of the battaile, came at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant on the backe of their enemies, and withall their might charging them, entred pell mell amongſt them, killing a great many, before ſuch time as they could turne their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to knowe from whence this miſchiefe came. The King accompanied with the Knight of the Lions, <hi>Adreſto,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> made a plaine way for the reſt to follow them, eſpecially the Knight of the Lions, who neuer ſtrake ſtroke but was either the death or diſmembring of ſome Knight. The Lord of <hi>Menew,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henault,</hi> did likewiſe the part of noble Knights: ſo as in ſhort ſpace the odds beganne to appeare on the ſide of the States, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were euen vanquiſhed. Which when the Earle <hi>Dowglaſſe</hi> ſawe and grieuing to behold, he with his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted company came to make head, where he ſawe moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and perceauing that the Knight of their Lions, was in a manner the whole ouerthrow of his Armie, hée ſet ſpurres to his horſe, and comming vnto him, gaue him a great blowe on his Helme, cauſing him to bend his head forwards. But he ſoone requited the ſame, for lifting vp his ſword, he gaue the Earle ſuch a blowe, that had he not warded the ſame with his ſhield, hee had ended therewith his life, for notwithſtanding his defence, it cauſed him to fall from his horſe in a traunce, and ſo was taken priſoner: to the great diſcouragement of the whole Armie, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put themſelues to flight, but were ſo hotly perſued, that they were but few that eſcaped, but were either ſlaine
<pb facs="tcp:150602:101"/> or taken priſoners. Of men of name, there was ſlaine of the States the Duke of <hi>Litſenburge,</hi> the Lord <hi>Londen,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Mildrope.</hi> And of the <hi>Scots</hi> &amp; traytors, there was ſlaine Sir <hi>Iames Lewrence</hi> the Earles Coſin, the Lord <hi>Crecon</hi> a Scot, and the Count <hi>Hermes,</hi> with ſome twenty thouſand of the Commons. There was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners the Earle <hi>Dowglaſſe,</hi> the Vicount Barwicke, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Maiance,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Harding,</hi> which two latter, were the next day executed for their rebellion.</p>
               <p>Thus the victory béeing obtained by the States, they gaue thanks to GOD with publique &amp; ſolemne prayers, then cauſing the wounded to be cured, they called a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to determine on their affaires, where all the chiefe of the Armie béeing aſſembled, euery man commended the great vallour of the Venturers, but eſpecially that of the Knight of the Lyons, the gréene Knight which was <hi>Adreſto,</hi> and the two tawny Knights, whereof the one was the King, the other the Lord <hi>Gwaltero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King now ſéeing it was not good longer to conceale himſelfe, ſtoode foorth in the midſt of the Aſſembly, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Helme, diſcouering his face, ſpake with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable loude voyce.</p>
               <p>My friends &amp; welbeloued Countrimen, I perceaue the long abſence of your King, hath worne out in many theyr naturall loue &amp; obedience which they ought to haue to theyr natiue Country: and alſo in moſt of you the knowledge of me, who by the prouidence of God, and vallour of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knight, (poynting to the Knight of the Lyons) am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from a long and grieuous impriſonment, which my Coſin <hi>Gwaltero,</hi> and many others héere preſent can well witneſſe, and now am come vnto the ayde of you my true and louing Subiects. Wherefore it is my will, that the chiefe of thoſe conſpirators who haue raiſed this rebellion, be to morrow next (to the example of all others) hangd, drawne and quartered.</p>
               <p>The whole Aſſembly hearing &amp; ſéeing theyr King, who for the ſpace of twenty yéeres they all imagined to be dead,
<pb facs="tcp:150602:101"/> with one voyce cryed aloude, <hi>Long liue King <hi>Fredericke</hi> to raine and rule ouer vs,</hi> and withall, ranne each ſtriuing to come firſt to kiſſe his hands, and welcome him into his kingdome: greatly deſiring to heare the cauſe of his long abſence, which was deferred till ſome other more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time. This newes was preſently ſpred through the whole Army, to the great ioy of all men, which they eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewed by their ſhoutes and bonfires which they made that night. The next day, the King hauing ſéene the execution of the chiefe Traytors, and pardoning the reſt, diſmiſſing all his Army, ſauing ſome few, which he ſent to the Townes that were in rebellion, which preſently yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto his mercie, he departed towards <hi>Maiance,</hi> hauing ſtill in his company the Knight of the Lyons and <hi>Adreſto,</hi> whom he intirely loued, and to whom he made many large proffers, if they pleaſed to haue ſtayed in his kingdome. And being come to <hi>Maiance,</hi> he was receiued with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ioy that might be by the Cittizens, where he remained by the ſpace of a month, in the greateſt ioy that hart could wiſh: ſaue onely the remembrance of his Quéene did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder the fulnes thereof, which was awhile ſwéetned with the delightfull company of his vnknowne ſonne, where I will leaue them, and ſo conclude the ſecond part of this hiſtory.</p>
